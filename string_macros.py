STRING MACROS - FEATURE LIST
===========================================================================

  Current version: v3.19.58
  File ratio (default 12): 2 Raw - 3 Inef - 7 Normal  (2:3:7)
  Time-sensitive ratio:    6 Raw - 0 Inef - 6 Normal  (1:1)

===========================================================================
                    GROUP 1: PAUSE BREAKS
===========================================================================

1. WITHIN-FILE PAUSES
   Files: Normal + Inef (Raw = 0%)
   Value: random % drawn fresh per file (decimal, never rounded):
     Normal: rng.uniform(2%, 5%)  e.g. 2.14%, 3.87%
     Inef:   rng.uniform(10%, 15%)  e.g. 11.6%, 13.2%
   e.g. 20s Normal file at 3.4% -> 0.68s pause
   One pause per file in middle 80%. Skips drags, rapid-clicks, pre-DragStart.

2. PRE-PLAY BUFFER
   Files: ALL (including between cycles in the outer loop)
   Value: rng.uniform(500, 800) ms * mult — applied before every file and
   between every cycle boundary (end of cycle N -> start of cycle N+1).
   Between-cycle buffer was added in v3.18.45 to prevent 0ms gap between
   the last DragEnd of one cycle and the cursor transition of the next,
   which caused drag-click at wrong position.

2b. PER-VERSION TARGET DURATION VARIANCE
    Each version gets a random target duration of base +/- 5 minutes.
    e.g. --target-minutes 60 produces versions targeting 55-65 min each.
    Drawn as rng.uniform(-300000, +300000) ms float per version.
    The effective target (used by the build loop) uses this per-version value.
    Inef massive pause budget is also pre-sampled against the per-version target.
    Shown in print output: "Target: 62m 14s (base 60m +2.2m)"

3. INEF BEFORE-FILE PAUSE
   Files: Inef only, only if current cycle >= 25s
   Value: rng.uniform(10000, 30000) ms flat (no mult)
   Added between each full cycle (F1->...->FN loop).
   Cursor drifts during this pause toward next file start position.

4. INEFFICIENT MASSIVE PAUSE
   Files: Inef only
   Value: rng.uniform(240000, 420000) ms flat (no mult) = 4-7 min
   One pause inserted at a safe random point after all cycles complete.
   Loop pre-samples pause so total file stays near target duration.
   Safe: no drag, no rapid-click, not pre-DragStart, not first/last 10%.

5. MULTIPLIER SYSTEM
   Continuous random range, 4 decimal places (never rounded):
     Raw:    rng.uniform(1.1, 1.2)  e.g. 1.13, 1.17
     Normal: rng.uniform(1.5, 1.7)  e.g. 1.53, 1.67
     Inef:   rng.uniform(2.0, 3.0)  e.g. 2.14, 2.87
   Multiplied (baked in at generation time):
     - Pre-play buffer: rng.uniform(500, 800) * mult
     - Cursor transition: rng.uniform(200, 400) * mult
     - Within-file % pause: file_duration * pct (pct not multiplied; the pause
       duration grows with larger files naturally)
     - Mid-event random pause (50% chance/cycle): rng.uniform(200, 800) * mult
   NOT multiplied (flat): inef before-file pause, massive pause, distraction files

===========================================================================
                    GROUP 2: PATTERN BREAKING
===========================================================================

6. CURSOR TRANSITION TO START POINT
   Files: ALL (SKIPPED for click-sensitive)
   Value: rng.uniform(200, 400) ms * mult — human path between files.
   Skipped entirely for click-sensitive folders.

7. IDLE CURSOR WANDERING
   Files: ALL (SKIPPED for click-sensitive)
   Fills existing recording gaps > 2000ms with cursor arcs/drifts.
   Does NOT add time — movements fit inside the existing gap.
   Not shown in manifest (zero time impact on total).

8. MOUSE JITTER
   Files: ALL (SKIPPED for click-sensitive)
   Value: 9-21% of mouse moves get +/-1-3px random offsets.
   Excluded near drags, rapid-click sequences, first/last 10% of file.

9. VIRTUAL QUEUE - SUBFOLDER FILES
   Each subfolder has its own shuffled queue. No file repeats until all
   others used. Boundary guard prevents same file at queue wrap.
   Same mechanism applies to distraction files (Feature 32).

===========================================================================
                    GROUP 3: SMOOTH OPERATION
===========================================================================

10. RAPID CLICK PROTECTION
    3+ clicks within 1500ms detected. Jitter exclusion extended to 1500ms.
    Detection set includes: Click, DragStart, LeftDown, LeftUp, RightDown, RightUp.
    LeftDown/LeftUp added (v3.18.81) so native button-event double-clicks are
    also protected — previously only 'Click' and 'DragStart' were detected.

11. DRAG OPERATION PROTECTION
    Hold+Move+Release detected. No jitter during entire drag sequence.

12. EVENT TIMING INTEGRITY
    No modifications inside drags, pre-DragStart, rapid-clicks, or first/
    last 10%. Prevents click-hold clamping (unintended long drags).

13. COMBINATION HISTORY
    Tracks used file combos per subfolder across cycles.
    Avoids repeating same combination. Persists via uploaded .txt files.

14. MANUAL HISTORY UPLOAD
    Upload COMBINATION_HISTORY_XX.txt to input_macros/combination_history/
    All .txt files read; those combos avoided in future runs.

15. ALPHABETICAL FILE NAMING
    Raw: ^XX_A  Inef: XX_C (not-sign prefix)  Normal: XX_E (no prefix)
    Output folder: (bundle_id) folder_name

16. FOLDER-NUMBER STRUCTURE
    F1, F2, F3.5 etc. F<N> prefix preferred; other numbers in name ignored.
    e.g. "F3- press 1 to bank" -> num=3, the "1" in name is ignored.

17. OPTIONAL TAG
    Default chance: rng.uniform(24%, 33%) per bundle (decimal, never rounded).
    Custom number: used as CENTRE of +/-2% random range (never rounded).
      e.g. "optional23" -> rng.uniform(21%, 25%)
           "optional50" -> rng.uniform(48%, 52%)
           "optional50.5" -> rng.uniform(48.5%, 52.5%)
    This adds variety so the same folder never hits the exact same threshold.
    Range clamped so it never goes below 1% or above 99%.
    Max-files/loops: "optional58-6-" = 58% centre, pick 1-6 files/loops.
    No optional: "F1-4-" = always included, pick 1-4 files.
    always_first/last wraps the entire picked group once (not per file).
    For nested folders: -N- means max N complete sub-cycles (loops), not files.

18. END TAG
    Uses word-boundary match (end) — "tend" does NOT match.
    Loop stops after this folder. Always included if reached.

19. OPTIONAL+END COMBO TAG
    Chosen = loop stops here. Skipped = loop continues.
    Renamed from "optional/end" in v3.18.42.

20. TIME SENSITIVE TAG
    Ratio: 1:1 (half raw, half normal, zero inef).
    Main folder tag propagates to ALL subfolders.

21. CLICK SENSITIVE TAG
    Disables ALL coordinate-changing features:
    cursor path, mouse jitter, idle wandering, distraction insertion.
    Main folder tag propagates to ALL subfolders.
    Accepted: "click sensitive" / "click/time sensitive" / "click+time sensitive"

22. CLICK/TIME SENSITIVE COMBO TAG
    Both tag rules active: 1:1 ratio + no cursor/jitter/idle/distraction.

23. DONT USE FEATURES ON ME TAG
    Exact folder name (case-insensitive). Files inserted completely unmodified.
    Marked [UNMODIFIED] in manifest.

24. ALWAYS FIRST / LAST FILES
    Tag in FILENAME (not folder name). Three modes:
    A) Root-level (next to F1/F2/F3 subfolders): fires ONCE per strung file,
       before all cycles start and after all cycles end.
    B) Inside a specific subfolder (e.g. F0): wraps ONLY that subfolder's files.
       Pattern: [AF] -> F0 files -> [AL] -> F1 -> F2 -> ...
    C) Flat/single-subfolder folder: fires ONCE at very start and very end.
    For nested folders (Feature 39): AF/AL wrap all loops together, not per loop.

25. COMPREHENSIVE MANIFEST
    !_MANIFEST_XX_!.txt in output folder. Shows per-version:
    - File type, multiplier, total pause added
    - Breakdown (x = mult applied, - = flat): PRE-Play Buffer, Within File Pauses,
      CURSOR to Start Point, POST-SNAP GAP, DISTRACTION File Pause,
      INEFFICIENT Before File Pause, INEFFICIENT MASSIVE PAUSE
    - Full file list with cumulative end times

26. SPECIFIC FOLDERS FILTERING
    --specific-folders <file>: process only folders (and optionally subfolders)
    listed in the file. Matching is case-insensitive, whitespace-stripped.

    File format (one entry per line):
      FolderName                   -> include folder, ALL its subfolders
      FolderName: F1, F3, F4       -> include folder, ONLY subfolders F1 F3 F4
      FolderName: F1, F3-F5        -> include folder, F1 and range F3 through F5

    Examples:
      22- Craft Dia- edge- lamp bank Z- S
      22- Craft Dia- edge- lamp bank Z- S: F1, F2, F4
      58- Smth R2H only: F1-F3

    - Subfolder numbers are case-insensitive (F1 = f1 = 1)
    - Decimal subfolders supported: F3.5
    - If a requested subfolder doesn't exist, it is skipped with a warning
    - Output folder: (bundle_id) folder_name

27. CHAT INSERTS
    --no-chat disables. After all versions are saved, floor(total * 0.20)
    files are chosen at random (all types eligible, including raw) and one
    chat file is spliced into each. 10 files → 2; 22 → 4; 5 → 1; 4 → 0.

28. PRE-PLAY BUFFER GUARANTEE
    files_added int counter (not list truthiness) ensures buffer fires before
    every file including always_first/last. Avoids Python nonlocal edge case.

29. FAIL-FAST ERROR HANDLING
    Fatal errors call sys.exit(1) so GitHub Actions fails at the right step.

30. FLAT FOLDER SUPPORT
    JSON files directly in main folder (no numbered subfolders) = single pool.
    All tags (always_first/last, time_sensitive, click_sensitive) still work.

31. DISTRACTION FILE GENERATION + INSERTION
    Trigger: DISTRACTIONS/ folder in input_macros/
    Generates 50 temp files (30s-2min), each using 3 of 7 features:
    wander, pause, right-click, typing, key-spam, shapes, backspace-hold.
    backspace-hold (v3.18.83): holds Backspace 1-3 s (float ms, not rounded).
    Chance: Normal 3.5-5%, Inef 3.5-7%, Raw 0%, Click-sensitive 0%.
    NOT multiplied — flat pre-built durations. Shown in manifest.

32. VIRTUAL QUEUE - DISTRACTION FILES
    All 50 distraction files rotate before any repeat.
    Boundary guard prevents consecutive repeat at queue wrap.

33. 2:3:7 FILE RATIO DISTRIBUTION
    raw=round(v x 2/12), inef=round(v x 3/12), normal=remainder.
    12->2:3:7, 24->4:6:14, 20->3:5:12.
    Time-sensitive override: 1:1 raw:normal, zero inef.

34. FILE TRANSITION START GAP PROTECTION
    80-150ms gap (POST-SNAP GAP) between snap MouseMove and first event of
    next file. Prevents zero-gap DragStart = cursor clamp at transition.
    Tracked in manifest as flat (no mult).

35. INTRA-FILE ZERO-GAP PROTECTION
    On load: two checks, both shift all events from the click forward.
    Part A — MouseMove->ButtonDown gap < 30ms shifted to 35ms.
    Prevents fast-cursor recordings clicking short of target tile.
    Raised from 15→30ms (v3.19.06): 15-29ms gaps were slipping through.
    Part B — DragEnd->DragStart gap < 200ms shifted to 200ms.
    Prevents rapid DragStart re-press. Threshold raised 150→200ms v3.18.92.
    Part C (v3.19.02) — any button-event->button-down gap < 200ms shifted
    to 200ms. Catches LeftUp→LeftDown, DragEnd→LeftDown, LD→LD (missing
    release), and all cross-type rapid re-press cases missed by A and B.
    Applied before any other features, to raw events only.

36. ORIGINAL FILES DEDUPLICATION
    Counts each unique filename once across all subfolders.
    Copied subfolders shown as "(N copied folder(s))" in manifest.

37. MAX-FILES TAG
    "-N-" in folder name = pick 1-N files (or loops for nested folders).
    "F3 optional58-6-" = 58% chance, 1-6 files.
    "F1-4-" = always included, 1-4 files.

38. PROBLEMATIC KEY FILTERING
    On load (before any features): strips keys that break macro playback.
    Filtered: HOME(36), END(35), PAGE_UP(33), PAGE_DOWN(34), PAUSE(19),
              PRINT_SCREEN(44)
    Kept: ESC(27) — valid in-game action (closing menus, cancelling dialogs).
    IMPORTANT: base_time captured BEFORE filtering so files whose only early
    event is a filtered key (e.g. END at t=90ms) keep their full duration.
    Without this, the 90ms anchor is lost and the file collapses to near-zero.

39. NESTED SUBFOLDER SUPPORT
    A numbered subfolder (e.g. F5) can contain its own F1/F2/F3/F4 instead
    of direct JSON files. Detected automatically during scanning.
    -N- on the outer folder = max N complete inner loops (not N files).
    always_first/last at F5's root level fire ONCE before all loops and
    ONCE after all loops (not per loop).
    Internal subfolders support all tags: optional, end, time/click sensitive.
    Separate ManualHistoryTracker maintained for nested folder's combos.

40. LOGOUT SEQUENCE FOLDER (Feature 40)
    Trigger: folder named 'LOGOUT, wait, in' (case-insensitive) at the root
    level of input_macros/.
    Contents: .json files assigned by numeric prefix in filename.
      Files assigned by numeric prefix in filename (e.g. '1- logout.json' → slot 1).
      Sub-slots supported (e.g. '1.1-' sorts between 1 and 2).
      Random wait fires after the last file whose prefix is 2.x.
      Any number of slots supported; minimum: one pre-2, one 2.x, one post-2.
    Two break files built per output folder (each with a fresh random wait):
    Long break:  7200000–16200000 ms (2h–4.5h)
    Short break: 1800000– 5400000 ms (30min–90min)
    Float ms, never rounded.
    Outputs: "@ LOGOUT LONG BREAK.json" + "@ LOGOUT SHORT BREAK.json"
    Features: NO anti-detection features applied (files inserted raw).
              filter_problematic_keys() is applied on load.
    Output: written to output_root/- logout.json, then copied to each
            bundle folder as "@ N LOGOUT.JSON" (same as static logout file).
    Priority: takes precedence over the legacy '- logout.json' static file.
    Fallback: if the folder is missing, the old static file search still runs.
    The folder is excluded from the main macro scan (not treated as a macro folder).
    Dedicated rng seeded from bundle_id + 31337 — does not affect main rng state.

41. SAME-NUMBER FOLDER POOLING (Feature 41)
    Multiple physical subfolders that share the same F-number are merged into
    a single logical slot in the cycle. The cycle still sees one slot per
    unique number; the combined pool of all matching folders is used for
    file selection and always_first/last picking.
    Examples:
      F2- Click anvil, F2- Click anvil - Copy, F2- dance
        → one F2 slot; files from all three folders pooled together
      F0 optional28-13-, F0 optional28-13- (1)
        → one F0 slot; 28% chance, pick up to 13 files from combined pool
    Merge rules:
      - files / always_first / always_last: concatenated
      - Boolean tags (is_optional, is_end, is_time_sensitive, is_click_sensitive):
        OR — if ANY contributing folder has the tag, the merged slot gets it
      - Scalar tags (optional_chance, max_files): first non-None value wins
      - Nested subfolders: inner dicts merged by inner slot number
    A [Pool] log line is printed for each merge: "F2: merged 'name' (N files total)"
    Trigger: folder named 'LOGOUT, wait, in' (case-insensitive) at the root
    level of input_macros/.
    Contents: .json files assigned by numeric prefix in filename.
      Files assigned by numeric prefix in filename (e.g. '1- logout.json' → slot 1).
      Sub-slots supported (e.g. '1.1-' sorts between 1 and 2).
      Random wait fires after the last file whose prefix is 2.x.
      Any number of slots supported; minimum: one pre-2, one 2.x, one post-2.
    Two break files built per output folder (each with a fresh random wait):
    Long break:  7200000–16200000 ms (2h–4.5h)
    Short break: 1800000– 5400000 ms (30min–90min)
    Float ms, never rounded.
    Outputs: "@ LOGOUT LONG BREAK.json" + "@ LOGOUT SHORT BREAK.json"
    Features: NO anti-detection features applied (files inserted raw).
              filter_problematic_keys() is applied on load.
    Output: written to output_root/- logout.json, then copied to each
            bundle folder as "@ N LOGOUT.JSON" (same as static logout file).
    Priority: takes precedence over the legacy '- logout.json' static file.
    Fallback: if the folder is missing, the old static file search still runs.
    The folder is excluded from the main macro scan (not treated as a macro folder).
    Dedicated rng seeded from bundle_id + 31337 — does not affect main rng state.

42. GROUP FOLDER SUPPORT
    Organizer folders one level below input_macros/ whose children have
    F-numbered subfolders (but the organizer itself does not) are treated as
    group folders. Selecting a group name runs all its children individually.
    Structure: input_macros/GroupName/Macro1, Macro2, ...
    Special folders (DISTRACTIONS, LOGOUT, combination_history) are never groups.

===========================================================================

CHANGELOG (recent):
===========================================================================
KNOWN ISSUES (not yet fixed):
- Manifest end-time accuracy: file end times are captured inside string_cycle()
  BEFORE apply_cycle_features() runs. Within-file pauses and the mid-event
  multiplier pause shift subsequent events forward, so "Ends at" timestamps for
  later files in a cycle can read slightly earlier than their true position in
  the final output. Raw files are unaffected (no pauses). Fix requires
  re-scanning cycle_with_features to re-derive per-file boundaries — deferred.
===========================================================================
KNOWN ISSUES (not yet fixed): (not yet fixed):
- Doubly-nested folder last-subfolder skip (FM+COOK F6-Wait / Cook F6-Wait):
  Even after v3.18.88's fix (skip outer used_combinations check when all slots
  are nested), occasional cycles are still observed without the final subfolder
  of one nested group. Root cause not yet fully isolated. The _all_nested=True
  path now returns immediately without the 500-attempt loop, which resolved the
  majority of cases but edge cases remain. Candidate causes: inner tracker
  virtual queue boundary guard interacting with small pools, or timing of
  _nested_trackers initialisation vs shared rng state. TO INVESTIGATE.
===========================================================================
- v3.18.89: Fix doubly-nested folder F6 skip (root cause of FM+COOK F6-Wait missing).
            v3.18.87's rollback approach was insufficient: it rolled back the inner
            tracker's used_combinations entry but NOT its queue position. After N failed
            outer attempts, all N W27 files were queue-consumed (gone from the deque)
            even though their sigs were restored. This exhausted the 38-file W27 pool
            in roughly 38 outer cycles, causing F6 to vanish from most subsequent cycles.
            CORRECT FIX: detect when ALL subfolder slots are purely nested (no direct
            files). In that case, the outer tracker's used_combinations check is both
            redundant (inner trackers already enforce uniqueness) and harmful (burns
            inner queue slots on rejected outer attempts). When _all_nested=True, skip
            the 500-attempt loop entirely (max_attempts=1) and return the combination
            immediately after building it. FM+COOK is the canonical case: F1=FM nested,
            F2=Cook nested. Each inner tracker manages its own F1-F6/F7 uniqueness
            independently without any outer interference.
- v3.18.87: Fix nested-folder inner-tracker exhaustion (root cause of F6-Wait random skip).
            BUG: In get_next_combination's 500-attempt loop, each failed outer attempt
            called _nested_tracker.get_next_combination() which permanently marked that
            inner combination as used — even though the outer sig was rejected. With 500
            outer attempts per call, the inner tracker (e.g. FM's F1-F6 tracker) had 500
            combinations consumed per outer get_next_combination() call. Over many cycles
            this exhausted the inner tracker far faster than the actual combination space,
            triggering the fallback which does not handle nested folders, causing the last
            subfolder (F6-Wait) to silently disappear from some cycles.
            FIX: Track inner tracker signatures committed during each outer attempt
            (_inner_commits list). If the outer signature is already in used_combinations
            (rejected), roll back all inner commits with used_combinations.discard().
            Inner combinations are now only permanently consumed when the outer combination
            is actually accepted and returned.
- v3.18.86: Fix UnboundLocalError for SEQUENCE REUSED (introduced v3.18.84).
            The tracker._sequence_reused check was placed before ManualHistoryTracker
            was created, crashing on every run. Fixed by removing the early check and
            instead doing a folder rename on disk AFTER the manifest is written and all
            versions are done — at which point tracker is guaranteed to exist.
- v3.19.58: Fixed duplicate group folder runs overwriting each other.
            ROOT CAUSE: when a group folder (e.g. 6- Smithing files) was
            selected 3x in the dropdowns, _run_suffix (" (2)", " (3)")
            was correctly set on each child folder_data but never applied
            in the _group_name branch — all three runs wrote to the same
            (543) 6- Smithing files/ wrapper, overwriting each other.
            FIX: _run_suffix now appended to the WRAPPER folder name:
              run 1: (543) 6- Smithing files/60- Only Smth R2H/
              run 2: (543) 6- Smithing files (2)/60- Only Smth R2H/
              run 3: (543) 6- Smithing files (3)/60- Only Smth R2H/
            Applied to both copies.
- v3.19.57: Bundle ID appended to strung output filenames.
            Format: 69_T_155m33s_(543).json
            Was:    69_T_155m33s.json
            Makes it easy to identify which batch a file came from
            when mixing files from different runs.
- v3.19.56: (random) files: idle gaps stripped + cursor 2.5-3.5x faster.
            ROOT CAUSE: within-file idle gaps (cursor parked 500-1755ms
            before clicks) and slow recorded movement (avg 230px/s) made
            (random) sequences feel sluggish even with between-file
            overhead removed.
            FIX: new event placement path for slot_is_random=True:
            1. _RANDOM_MAX_GAP_MS=120ms — any inter-event gap in the
               original recording exceeding 120ms is clamped to 120ms,
               stripping parked-cursor idle periods.
            2. _RANDOM_SPEED_MULT=rng.uniform(2.5,3.5) — all inter-event
               intervals divided by this factor, compressing movement to
               ~575-800px/s (focused fast player feel).
            Both applied per-event on the original timestamps before
            placement onto the timeline. Applied to both copies.
- v3.19.55: (random) folders: all timing overhead removed, cursor 2-2.5x faster.
            Previously is_click_sensitive suppressed jitter/idle/mid-pause
            but intra-file pause (Step 3), pre-file pause (500-800ms),
            and post-snap gap (80-150ms) still ran between each file.
            Changes:
            - Step 3 (intra-file pause) now forced to 0% for all
              click_sensitive folders (file_type='raw'), both copies.
            - slot_is_random param added to add_file_to_cycle (both copies).
            - Pre-file pause skipped entirely when slot_is_random=True.
            - Cursor transition speed divided by rng.uniform(2.0,2.5)
              for slot_is_random — mouse moves 2-2.5x faster to next pos.
            - Post-snap gap skipped for slot_is_random.
            - slot_is_random=True passed from _play_nested_loop for all
              _random_single items (both copies).
            Net result: (random) files play with only cursor movement
            between them, at 2-2.5x normal transition speed.
- v3.19.54: (random) folders are now implicitly click_sensitive.
            No pauses, jitter, idle movements, intra-file pauses or any
            other timing/anti-detection features apply to files inside
            (random) tagged folders. Only cursor movement between files
            is retained. is_click_sensitive forced True whenever
            is_random is True in scan_for_numbered_subfolders.
            Applied to both copies.
- v3.19.53: (random) manifest now shows parent F-number not sub-number.
            Previously files from sub-subfolders (1/, 2/, drop sword (1)/)
            were logged as F1-, F2- etc in the manifest. Now they all show
            as the parent step number e.g. F6- matching the F-step folder
            that carries the (random) tag.
            _parent_folder_num stored on each _random_single dict item.
            _play_nested_loop accepts parent_folder_num param; uses it as
            manifest folder_num when _random_single is True.
            Applied to both copies.
- v3.19.52: Extended (random) tag with two improvements.
            1) Sub-subfolder detection now also matches bracketed numbers
               anywhere in the folder name (e.g. 'drop sword (1)',
               'drop shield (2)'). Previously only leading digit or F-prefix
               was accepted. Detection: re.search(r'\(\d+\)', d.name).
               Number extraction already handled by existing fallback regex.
            2) New (randomN) variant: add a number directly e.g. (random10).
               Shuffles all sub-subfolder keys then picks the first N,
               plays 1 file from each. With 28 folders and (random10):
               every cycle picks 10 different folders at random, plays one
               file each, then moves on. random_max stored on slot entry,
               applied as _sub_nums = _sub_nums[:_rmax] after shuffle.
               Both applied to both copies.
- v3.19.51: New folder tag: (random). Add to any F-step folder that
            contains numbered sub-subfolders (1/, 2/, 3/, ...). Each
            cycle, the code picks exactly ONE file from EACH sub-subfolder
            in a freshly randomised order, strings them all, then continues
            to the next F-step as normal. Example:
              F6- (random) click drop/
                1/   <- 1 file picked
                2/   <- 1 file picked
                3/   <- 1 file picked
            Order of 1/2/3 is shuffled each cycle. No AF/AL wrapping
            on the individual files (they are standalone picks).
            Detection in scan_for_numbered_subfolders (is_random flag).
            Branching in get_next_combination (shuffled pick-one-per-sub).
            _play_nested_group skips AF/AL for _random_single items.
            Applied to both copies.
- v3.19.50: Group subfolder wrapping restored to always-on.
            v3.19.45 made it opt-in via --group-subfolders (default off),
            removing the wrapping by default. Reverted: _group_name check
            no longer gated on args.group_subfolders. Group children always
            wrap inside (bundle_id) skill_name/ e.g. (543) 1- Woodcutting
            files/ containing all its subfolders. Both copies.
- v3.19.49: Fixed convergence check blind spot on first MM in file.
            _prev_mm_x/_prev_mm_y were initialised to None, causing the
            convergence check to be skipped entirely for the very first
            MouseMove in the event list (no previous position to compare).
            That MM was always jitter-eligible even if it was part of an
            approach to the first click. Fix: seed _prev_mm_x/_prev_mm_y
            from the position of the first click in the event list, so
            any MM converging toward it from the start is correctly
            excluded. Applied to both copies.
- v3.19.48: Fixed NameError '_ex' in convergence check (v3.19.46).
            Typo: _ex should be ex. Both copies. One-character fix.
- v3.19.47: Start buffer added. timeline initialised to
            rng.uniform(5000.0, 8000.0)ms instead of 0. Produces 5–8s
            of silence before the first event in every strung file,
            giving the macro player time to initialise. Random float,
            non-rounded. Applied to both copies.
- v3.19.46: Jitter convergence check added to add_pre_click_jitter.
            ROOT CAUSE: jitter exclusion used only time-distance (1000ms)
            from clicks. Approach trajectories spanning >1000ms were
            partially jitterable — the cursor zigzagged during the sweep
            toward a click, misplacing it at the target tile. Observed as
            "cursor hovers, moves away, comes back too late for click."
            FIX: added convergence check to safe_movements filter. A MM is
            excluded if it is closer to the next upcoming click (within 5s)
            than the previous MM was — i.e. it is part of an approach path.
            Uses squared distance (no sqrt) for speed. 100% coverage of
            approach MMs in test file, zero false positives on idle MMs.
            Applied to both copies.
- v3.19.45: Group subfolder wrapping made opt-in via --group-subfolders
            flag (default: OFF). Previously group children were always
            wrapped inside (bundle_id) skill_name/ in the output bundle.
            Now flat by default — group children output as
            (bundle_id) subfolder_name/ directly under bundle_dir.
            Pass --group-subfolders to restore the nested structure.
            YML: new boolean toggle 'group_subfolders' (default: false).
            Applied to both copies.
- v3.19.44: _add_right_click target changed from nearby offset to safe
            neutral zone. Previously right-clicked at cur_x±20-200px /
            cur_y±15-140px — could land near recorded macro cursor areas
            and interact with game objects. Now always moves to one of
            four pre-defined safe zones (minimap area x=548-700,y=10-160
            or interface panel x=548-730,y=340-500) before clicking.
            These regions are inert to right-click in OSRS and far from
            the game viewport where macro actions occur. Zone chosen
            randomly per call so pattern stays varied. Both copies.
- v3.19.43: Two click-protection hardening fixes.
            FIX 1 — DragEnd added to jitter exclusion click_types.
            Previously jitter excluded MMs within 1000ms of DragStart
            but NOT DragEnd. A MM at DS+1050ms / DE+950ms was outside
            the DS exclusion zone and eligible for jitter, inserting
            random micro-movements in the post-release window just before
            a subsequent action. DragEnd now anchors its own 1000ms
            before+after exclusion zone. Applied to both copies.
            FIX 2 — detect_rapid_click_sequences pixel tolerance raised
            from 10px to 20px, matching Part B soft-path _RAPID_POS_TOL_SOFT.
            Clicks 11-20px apart were caught by Part B's soft-path for the
            direct DE→DS case, but NOT by detect_rapid_click_sequences.
            Inter-click MMs in that gap were therefore unprotected from
            intra-file and mid-event pause injection. Now consistent:
            any two clicks <=20px apart within 2s are fully protected.
            Applied to both copies of detect_rapid_click_sequences.
- v3.19.42: Fixed UnboundLocalError on _drag_idx_cache.
            ROOT CAUSE: _drag_idx_cache only assigned inside
            `if not is_raw and not is_click_sensitive and rng.random() < 0.50`.
            When false (raw files, click-sensitive, or 50% RNG miss),
            variable never set but referenced in insert_idle_mouse_movements
            call below. FIX: _drag_idx_cache = None before the conditional
            in both copies. insert_idle_mouse_movements handles None
            correctly (falls back to build_drag_index_set internally).
- v3.19.41: Cache hit path changed from copy.deepcopy to list
            comprehension. deepcopy: 0.583ms. List comprehension: 0.040ms.
            14.6x speedup on cache hits. Safe because all event field
            values are immutable primitives (str, int, None).
            build_drag_index_set deduplicated in apply_cycle_features:
            precomputed once as _drag_idx_cache, passed to
            insert_idle_mouse_movements via prebuilt_drag_index param.
            Saves ~1.4s per full run. Applied to both copies.
            Combined with v3.19.40 file cache: projected runtime ~1-2min.
- v3.19.40: Fixed cache not actually skipping Parts A-F on fast path.
            ROOT CAUSE: Parts A-F (# INTRA-FILE ZERO-GAP FIX block) were
            OUTSIDE the if/else block — ran on every call including cache
            hits. Cache only saved disk I/O and filter_problematic_keys,
            not the heavy A-F loops. deepcopy on large arrays also costly.
            FIX: Indented entire Parts A-F + cache store block into the
            else: branch (slow path only). Fast path now deepcopies cached
            events and jumps directly to # Check if dmwm file, skipping
            all filter + A-F processing. Applied to both copies.
- v3.19.39: Two-level file cache added to add_file_to_cycle.
            Level 1 (_raw_file_cache): avoids re-reading source files
            from disk for the same path. Level 2 (_processed_events_cache):
            avoids re-running filter_problematic_keys + Parts A-F for
            the same file across multiple versions. deepcopy used on
            retrieval to ensure each call gets a fresh mutable copy.
            _fixed_logout_cache: fixed logout file built once per unique
            logout folder path, reused across all versions.
            Expected speedup: 10-20x on multi-version, multi-folder runs.
            Memory cost: ~50-80MB additional RAM (input file strings +
            processed event arrays). Safe on GitHub Actions runners.
            Applied to both copies.
- v3.19.38: Fixed group folder wrapper not applying in output.
            ROOT CAUSE: output block checked `if args.specific_folders`
            first, then `elif _group_name`. In specific-folders mode,
            group children entering via _group_registry DID have _group_name
            set, but the specific_folders branch fired first and ignored it,
            writing flat (batch) subfolder_name/ instead of the wrapper.
            FIX: reordered to check `_group_name` FIRST in both copies.
            Group children now always wrap in (batch) skill_name/ regardless
            of whether specific-folders or ALL FOLDERS mode is active.
            Added debug print: "[group] _group_name=... → path" so the
            console confirms wrapper activation every run.
            Applied to both copies.
- v3.19.37: Group folder outputs now wrapped in (batch) skill_name/
            subfolder inside bundle_dir. ALL FOLDERS mode on a skill
            group (e.g. 6- Smithing files) produces:
              (470) 6- Smithing files/60- Only Smth R2H/
            instead of flat (470) 60- Only Smth R2H/.
            Specific-folders mode unchanged (batch prefix on subfolder).
            @ logout_profiles and @ logout_sequence added to _SCAN_SKIP.
            Group child iteration skips any folder starting with '@'.
            scan_for_numbered_subfolders skips '@'-prefixed subfolders.
            Prevents @ logout_profiles from generating spurious strung
            files when placed inside a skill folder.
            Applied to both copies.
- v3.19.35: Removed Part E OOB click event clamp (added in v3.19.27).
            ROOT CAUSE: The clamp incorrectly moved DragStart/RightDown
            coords to the last safe Y>=80 position for ANY click with
            Y<80, including legitimate game clicks near the top of the
            OSRS window (e.g. Falch DragStart at Y=42 coming from Y=93).
            This clamped click then received a Part A/F settling MM at
            the wrong clamped position, causing the visible cursor-jump-
            before-click symptom. Distraction file right clicks at
            Y<80 were also incorrectly clamped, producing random clicks
            at wrong tiles.
            FIX: The idle-parking MM clamp (gap_after >= OOB_IDLE_GATE)
            is sufficient for the defocus issue — it prevents the cursor
            from being parked in browser chrome territory. Clicks in the
            Y<80 zone are legitimate game actions and must not be moved.
            Part E idle-parking protection fully intact.
            Applied to both copies.
- v3.19.34: Logout path detection checks all candidate paths.
            each one so the console shows exactly which resolved or why
            none matched. Three candidates checked for @ logout_sequence/:
            folder_data['path']/, folder_data['path'].parent/,
            search_base/folder_data['name']/ — covers all nesting modes
            (ALL FOLDERS and specific-folders). Hub and global fallback
            unchanged. Diagnostic output allows pinpointing mismatches.
- v3.19.33: Logout detection 3-level hierarchy via .is_dir().
            — zero variable-scope ambiguity.
            Level 1: skill_folder/@ logout_sequence/ (place folder here
            for skill-specific sequence, shared by all its subfolders).
            Level 2: @ logout_profiles/ hub (exact name, then leading-
            number fallback) — unchanged from v3.19.32.
            Level 3: input_macros/LOGOUT, wait, in/ global fallback.
            Console always prints which level matched or exactly what
            was checked when nothing found.
            Backward-compatible: old LOGOUT, wait, in/ folders still
            work as level-3 fallback.
- v3.19.32: Rebuilt logout system around @ logout_profiles/ hub.
            Single source of truth: input_macros/@ logout_profiles/
            with one subfolder per skill (matched by exact name, then
            leading-number fallback). Per skill folder, 3 files built:
              @ {slots}.json          -- fixed sequence, no random wait
              @ LOGOUT SHORT BREAK    -- random wait 30-90min after 2-
              @ LOGOUT LONG BREAK     -- random wait 2h-4.5h after 2-
            @ Final logout X client.json copied from input_macros/ to
            every output skill folder. Error printed (not silent skip)
            if no profile found for a skill. All randomization isolated
            to the 2- slot only; all other slots unchanged.
            Removed: @ logout_base/, @ logout_extras/, all previous
            LOGOUT, wait, in/ folder detection.
- v3.19.31: Fixed logout extras never attaching (v3.19.30 bug).
            ROOT CAUSE 1: used `folder.name` (undefined in loop scope)
            instead of `folder_data['name']` (the actual loop dict key).
            ROOT CAUSE 2: exact name match only — '6- Smithing files'
            would never match '@ logout_extras/6- Smithing/'.
            FIX: leading-number match — extract digits from
            folder_data['name'] (e.g. '6') and check all subfolders in
            '@ logout_extras/' for same leading number. Exact name match
            tried first as fast path; leading-number fallback catches any
            naming variation. Diagnostic print always shows what matched
            or why it didn't (folder name + leading num shown).
- v3.19.30: Redesigned logout system with @ logout_base / @ logout_extras.
              input_macros/@ logout_base/   -- numbered base slot files
              input_macros/@ logout_extras/<SkillName>/ -- optional extras
            build_logout_sequence now takes base_folder_path + optional
            extras_folder_path. Assembly order for every output file:
              [base slots 0,1,2...] -> [random wait on last 2.x slot]
              -> [base slots 3+] -> [extras sorted alphabetically]
            Extras discovered dynamically: checks for
            @ logout_extras/<folder.name>/ matching current skill folder.
            Falls back to base-only if no matching extras folder exists.
            Filename reflects full slot sequence including extras
            (e.g. base 0123 + 2 extras = @ 012345 Proper logout...).
            Long break, short break, and fixed file all use same extras.
            Removed: LOGOUT, wait, in detection, _logout_folder,
            _global_logout_folder, _active_logout.
- v3.19.29: Reverted v3.19.28 _active_logout variable fix — it was wrong.
            The outer loop `for folder in sorted(search_base.iterdir()):`
            at line 4323 makes `folder` the skill folder Path (e.g.
            '6- Smithing files/'). The `_active_logout` check is nested
            inside that loop so `folder` is in scope and correct.
            `folder_data['path']` (changed to in v3.19.28) points to a
            per-version subfolder path, not the skill folder — so
            `_active_logout.is_dir()` always returned False and all
            builds fell back to the global LOGOUT folder.
            Feature confirmed working in v3.19.25 with `folder`; this
            restores that behaviour.
- v3.19.28: Fixed skill-specific LOGOUT detection using wrong variable.
            Active main() loop variable is `folder_data` (dict), not
            `folder` (Path). `folder_data['path']` is the skill folder
            Path. Using bare `folder` evaluated to wrong/outer scope
            value, so `_active_logout.is_dir()` always returned False
            and all folders fell back to the global LOGOUT folder.
            Fix: replace `folder / "LOGOUT, wait, in"` with
            `folder_data['path'] / "LOGOUT, wait, in"` in both copies.
- v3.19.27: Part D threshold raised from 20ms to 25ms. Caught 22ms
            MM->DE gaps in CBD__50_ and CBD__9_ (recording artifacts
            where cursor barely moves during click hold, 2ms above
            old threshold).
            Part F added: settling MM inserted when MM->click gap
            > 1000ms (outside jitter exclusion zone). Fixes CBD__30_
            (1807ms) and FMFcraftdia__62_ DS[110] (1022ms).
            Part E extended to clamp OOB RightDown/DragStart/LeftDown
            click events. Fixes FMFcraftdia__62_ RightDown at Y=39
            (browser chrome) which caused game defocus at 69% of file,
            making second half of clicks fail in strung playback.
            Fixed LOGOUT, wait, in being scanned as a skill subfolder.
            Fixed LOGOUT skill-specific folder detection regression
            (must use outer loop folder variable, not per-version).
            Applied to both copies.
- v3.19.26: Raised Part E _OOB_SAFE_Y_MIN from 50 to 80.
            ROOT CAUSE (CBD__5_.json): cursor parked at Y=57 for 9820ms
            -- slipped through Part E (Y=57 > old threshold of 50 by 7px).
            Intra-file pause extended idle to ~12.5s at Y=57, causing game
            window defocus before final click at (945,357). Threshold 80
            catches Y=21 (SRADM), Y=57 (this file), leaves Y=80+ intact.
            Only affects cursors PARKED in gaps >= _OOB_IDLE_GATE (1000ms).
            ALSO: '- Quick logout wait RELOGIN.json' at repo root is now
            copied to all output folders as '@ Quick logout wait RELOGIN.json'
            alongside '@ Final logout.json'. Same copy-with-prefix pattern.
            Applied to both copies.
- v3.19.25: Reverted skill-specific logout approach (v3.19.20-24).
            New design: if a skill folder (e.g. '6- Smithing files/')
            contains its own 'LOGOUT, wait, in' subfolder, that folder
            is used to build all logout files for that skill's subfolders.
            Falls back to global input_macros/LOGOUT, wait, in/ otherwise.
            No filename parsing or skill-tag matching needed -- the folder
            structure itself carries the skill-specific information.
            @ 0123 Proper logout+wait+RELOGIN.json (and variants) built
            dynamically per output folder; name reflects actual slots used.
            Long/short break random wait behaviour unchanged.
            Removed: _extract_skill_tag_from_logout_name,
                     _logout_tag_matches_folder, _skill_folder_name.
- v3.19.24: Fixed skill-folder matching in build_logout_sequence callers.
            ROOT CAUSE: cleaned_folder_name (subfolder output name e.g.
            '60- Only Smth R2H') was passed as skill_folder_name instead
            of folder.name (outer loop skill folder e.g. '6- Smithing
            files'). Tag '6- smithing files' was compared against '60-...'
            giving leading digit '6' != '60' -> always False -> skill-specific
            slots never included. Fix: capture _skill_folder_name = folder.name
            at outer loop level and pass it to all three build_logout_sequence
            calls. Matching logic and tag extraction were correct throughout.
            Long/short break random wait behaviour confirmed unchanged.
- v3.19.23: Reworked logout file generation. Reverts v3.19.20-22 scan/stitch
            approach. New design:
            1. build_logout_sequence now uses numeric prefix detection
               (replacing keyword detection) with skill-specific file support.
               Files with (skill-tag) in name (e.g. '4- open bank (6- smithing)')
               are included only for folders whose leading number matches.
               Universal files (no tag) always included.
            2. @ 01234 Proper logout+wait+RELOGIN.json is now BUILT per
               output folder (not copied from repo root). wait_range_ms=None
               produces clean concatenation (no random wait on slot 2).
               Filename reflects actual slots used (e.g. @ 012345).
            3. Long/short break files gain same skill-specific slot support.
            4. LOGOUT, wait, in folder is now the single source of truth for
               all logout content -- universal and skill-specific.
            New helpers: _extract_skill_tag_from_logout_name,
                         _logout_tag_matches_folder.
- v3.19.22: Fixed stitch_logout_extension (3rd bug): base file was not
            being filtered (filter_problematic_keys) or normalised to
            t=0 before stitching. END key at t=0 was preserved in output
            and original time offset was retained causing timing corruption
            in the stitched result. Both base and extra slots are now
            filtered and normalised before assembly.
            Also confirmed fix from v3.19.21 (wrong loop variable, scope).
            Stitch logic verified against real files: 601-event base +
            191-event extra (5-) = 787-event output, 2.71 min.
- v3.19.21: Fixed v3.19.20 logout extension feature (two bugs).
            BUG 1: scan_folder_slot_files was called with search_base
            (input_macros/ root) instead of folder (current skill folder).
            The 5- file lives inside e.g. '6- Smithing files/', not in
            input_macros/ root. Fixed to use `folder` variable.
            BUG 2: _extra_logout was scoped inside if _logout_folder:
            block, making it inaccessible to the for _fixed_name: loop
            which sits outside that block. Fixed by defining _extra_logout
            before the if block -- always [] or populated, never undefined.
            Both bugs meant the feature silently did nothing in all cases.
- v3.19.20: New feature — skill-folder logout extension.
            If the top level of a skill folder contains loose JSON files
            with numeric prefixes (e.g. '5- cam and zoom adjust.json'),
            those files are stitched in numerical order onto the end of
            all logout-type files for that specific folder:
              @ LOGOUT LONG BREAK.json
              @ LOGOUT SHORT BREAK.json
              @ 01234 Proper logout+wait+RELOGIN.json
                 -> @ 012345 Proper logout+wait+RELOGIN.json (renamed)
            Files without extras are unchanged. filter_problematic_keys
            applied to each extra slot on load. 500-800ms buffer between
            base and each extra slot. Name reflects actual slot sequence.
            New helpers: scan_folder_slot_files, stitch_logout_extension.
- v3.19.19: insert_intra_file_pauses now excludes pause points within
            +-2000ms of any RightDown or RightUp event (_RC_EXCL_MS=2000).
            ROOT CAUSE: _PRESS_TYPES check only blocked pauses AT or
            immediately BEFORE right-click events. No forward window
            protection existed after RightUp, meaning a pause could land
            in the RightUp->menu-selection-DragStart window if any gap
            there reached 2000ms. Right-click sequences must play exactly
            as recorded -- a pause mid-sequence delays cursor arrival at
            the menu option, risking wrong selection or menu dismissal.
            Pattern follows v3.19.17 MouseWheel exclusion architecture.
            Files with no right-clicks are unaffected.
            Applied to both copies.
- v3.19.18: Raised Part A _ZERO_GAP_THRESHOLD from 30ms to 35ms.
            ROOT CAUSE: DS events with 30-34ms MM->click gaps slipped
            through Part A undetected. At 33ms the cursor may still be
            in micro-deceleration when the click fires, causing 1-2px
            tile misses in strung playback (observed in FMF_SmthAlch
            DS[599] at (942,327) with 33ms gap - 3ms above old threshold).
            Standalone playback was unaffected because the physical mouse
            naturally settled within the recording's timing.
            _ZERO_GAP_TARGET remains 35ms - threshold now equals target,
            so all gaps in [0,35) are uniformly shifted to 35ms with a
            settling MM at the click's exact coordinates.
            Applied to both copies.
- v3.19.17: insert_intra_file_pauses now excludes pause points within
            +-1000ms of any MouseWheel event (_MW_EXCL_MS = 1000ms).
            ROOT CAUSE: MouseWheel events had no exclusion zone protection.
            Pauses could land in gaps immediately before scroll sequences,
            desynchronising timed scrolling from in-game states (inventory
            page, interface selection). DragStart/click exclusion zones
            already existed but did not cover wheel events.
            Uses bisect for O(n log m) filtering — zero cost for files
            with no scroll events.
            Applied to both copies.
- v3.19.16: build_logout_sequence now assigns slots by numeric filename
            prefix (e.g. '2- file.json' -> slot 2.0) instead of keywords
            ('proper', 'nothing', 'relogin'). Sub-slots like '1.1-' sort
            naturally between neighbours, mirroring F-folder numbering.
            Any number of slots supported. Random wait always fires after
            the last 2.x slot. Validation requires at least one pre-2,
            one 2.x, and one post-2 file. Duplicate slot numbers log a
            warning and keep the first match.
- v3.19.15: Added _MAX_SINGLE_PAUSE_MS = 1,536,000ms (25.6 min) hard cap.
            Applied via min() at all 4 pause generation points: intra-file
            % pause, massive pause, mid-event pause, before-file pause.
            In practice only the intra-file % pause can approach the ceiling
            (very long source files at 15% pct); all others are well below.
            ALSO: cursor transition no longer skipped for click-sensitive
            folders. Only jitter (Step 1) and idle wandering (Step 4) in
            apply_cycle_features remain suppressed for click-sensitive.
            Transition is position-critical, not accuracy-sensitive, so
            running it for click-sensitive folders is safe and correct.
            slot_is_click_sensitive suppression unchanged.
- v3.19.14: Expanded rapid pre-scan to detect soft double-clicks (cursor drift
            between clicks). Previous scanner required DS->DE->DS with no events
            in between (strict same-tile pattern). Now also detects
            DS->DE->(MMs)->DS within 500ms and 20px drift (_RAPID_POS_TOL_SOFT).
            These are marked as soft_double_protected and skipped by Part B.
            ROOT CAUSE: Double-clicks with slight cursor movement between them
            (e.g. 15px drift) were structurally invisible to the rapid pre-scan
            (type_ok=False) leaving them unrecognised by any protection.
            Applied to both copies.
- v3.19.13: Per-version target duration variance widened from ±5min to ±15min.
            Each version independently draws a random offset in [-15, +15] min
            from the base target. A max(60000ms) floor prevents negative targets
            on very short base durations. Full-cycle guarantee unchanged —
            get_sequence() always completes a natural cycle end before stopping.
            Console output now shows actual signed variance (e.g. var +12.3m).
- v3.19.12: Added out-of-bounds MouseMove clamp (new Part E).
            ROOT CAUSE: Source recordings can contain cursor positions
            outside the game canvas (e.g. Y=21 = browser title bar) that
            were safe when recorded by a human (no click = no focus change)
            but cause focus loss during simulated playback — the OS/browser
            reacts to the simulated cursor entering system UI areas. The
            cursor then parks at the bad position for the duration of the
            idle gap, and the following click fires on an unfocused window.
            FIX: New Part E loop runs after Part D. For each MM whose
            coordinates are outside safe bounds (_OOB_SAFE_Y_MIN=50,
            _OOB_SAFE_Y_MAX=900, X=0-1920), if the gap AFTER the event
            is >= _OOB_IDLE_GATE (1000ms) — meaning the cursor is about
            to be parked there — replace its X/Y with the last known
            safe position. Fast-moving paths that pass through unusual
            coords mid-sweep are left untouched (small gap_after).
            Applied to both copies.
- v3.19.11: Added zero-gap DragEnd guard (new Part D).
            ROOT CAUSE: A DragEnd firing at the exact same timestamp as
            the preceding MouseMove (0ms gap) causes the button-release
            to register while the cursor is still mid-movement. No
            existing protection caught this — Part A only watches
            button-down types, Part B only catches DE->DS pairs, Part C
            skips DragEnd entirely.
            FIX: New Part D loop runs after Part C. When a DragEnd has
            a gap < _DRAG_END_SETTLE_THRESHOLD from the preceding
            MouseMove, shift the DragEnd (and all following events)
            forward by (_DRAG_END_SETTLE_TARGET - gap) ms. Does not
            insert a new MM — DragEnd is a release, not a position
            event, so only time correction is needed.
            Applied to both copies.
- v3.19.10: Part A now inserts a settling MouseMove at the click's exact
            coordinates before the click fires, not just a time shift.
            ROOT CAUSE: Part A shifted the click forward 35ms but left the
            cursor parked at the last recorded MM position (Bx-4, By-3).
            Since the macro player clicks at cursor position (not at the
            stored X/Y in the DragStart event), the click still fired at
            the wrong tile.
            FIX: When Part A detects a gap and the click event has X/Y,
            insert a MouseMove at (click_x, click_y) timed 15ms before
            the (now-shifted) click. Cursor is guaranteed to be at the
            correct tile when the click fires.
            Applied to both copies.
- v3.19.09: Protect intentional rapid-click / double-click from Part B/C shifts.
            A double-click (DS->DE->DS at same tile, 86ms gap) was being shifted
            by Part B (threshold 200ms), breaking its timing. A rapid-click
            pre-scan now marks such DS indices as RAPID_PROTECTED before Part B/C
            run. Both parts skip those indices. Applied to both copies.
- v3.19.08: Correct fix for false SEQUENCE REUSED for flat/single-slot folders.
            v3.19.07 addressed the symptom (reset when pool exhausted) but
            the root fix is conceptual:
            The per-cycle combination signature tracks ONE file per cycle.
            For a flat folder with 118 files, "unique combinations" at the
            per-cycle level is only 118 possibilities. Once all 118 are "used"
            every future cycle fails → SEQUENCE REUSED.
            But the actual version-level sequence space is P(118,6)=2.37 trillion
            (or 118! if all files used). The sequences ARE unique even if
            individual files repeat — what matters is the ORDER across cycles.
            CORRECT FIX: for single-slot folders (flat folders), skip the
            used_combinations check entirely. The _next_file queue (Fisher-Yates
            shuffle per refill) is the correct mechanism — it guarantees no file
            repeats until all pool items are used once per pass, which is far
            stronger than per-cycle deduplication. SEQUENCE REUSED should only
            fire for multi-slot folders where F1=X AND F2=Y AND F3=Z can repeat.
            Detection: _is_single_slot = len(subfolder_files) == 1 and all slots
            contain only direct files (no nested subfolder files).
- v3.19.07: Fix false SEQUENCE REUSED for flat folders (superseded).
            ROOT CAUSE: A flat folder (118 FUNSAL files, single slot)
            has only 118 possible unique combination signatures.
            22 versions × ~6 cycles = ~132 total cycles per run. Once
            all 118 single-file signatures are in used_combinations
            (within the same run), the 500-attempt loop fails on every
            attempt — all possible signatures are already "seen" — so
            SEQUENCE REUSED fires, even though file orders ARE unique
            (it just means files naturally need to repeat after all 118
            are used once, like a full deck reshuffle).
            Note: multi-slot history loading was also broken for flat
            folders — single-slot signatures (no "|") were never loaded
            from history (history parse required "|") so that path was
            never the issue; the in-memory deduplication was the culprit.
            FIX A: compute total_possible = product of pool sizes for
            all slots. After loading history, if used >= total_possible,
            clear used_combinations (full rotation complete, start over).
            FIX B: in the 500-attempt loop, if used_combinations reaches
            total_possible during the run, reset it mid-run so repeated
            files after full rotation are allowed without SEQUENCE REUSED.
            Both fixes applied to both copies of ManualHistoryTracker.
- v3.19.06: Part A threshold raised 15ms → 30ms (cursor-settle fix).
            ROOT CAUSE: Fast source recordings sometimes have the cursor
            still moving when DragStart fires. The cursor passed through X0
            (slightly short of target X1) and DragStart fired at X0.
            Part A catches MM→ButtonDown gaps < 15ms and shifts to 20ms.
            Gaps of 15-29ms slipped through: the cursor was still in transit
            at that last MouseMove (X0) when DragStart fired.
            FIX: raise Part A threshold 15→30ms, target 35ms.
            Any MM→ButtonDown gap under 30ms is now shifted so there's
            at least 35ms of stillness before the click fires — enough for
            the macro player to register the cursor at its final position.
            Applied to both copies. Part B/C thresholds unchanged.
- v3.19.05: Per-subfolder click/time sensitivity.
            ROOT CAUSE: folder_is_click_sensitive was computed as
            `any(fd.get("is_click_sensitive") for fd in subfolder_files.values())`.
            If ANY subfolder (e.g. F6) was click-sensitive, the whole cycle was
            flagged click-sensitive, suppressing jitter/idle/transitions for ALL
            subfolders including F1-F5 and F7-F8 which are normal.
            FIX A: folder_is_click_sensitive now only reflects the MAIN FOLDER
            name tag (used for whole-cycle apply_cycle_features). It no longer
            escalates from per-subfolder tags.
            FIX B: add_file_to_cycle gains a slot_is_click_sensitive parameter.
            When playing files for a click-sensitive subfolder slot, transitions
            TO that slot are suppressed. apply_cycle_features (jitter, idle,
            mid-event pause) still runs on the whole cycle via the main-folder
            flag, which is now False unless the main folder itself is tagged.
            FIX C: per-slot time-sensitivity treated the same way — the inef/raw
            file-type selection per slot respects subfolder is_time_sensitive
            via get_sequence, unchanged. This was already correct.
- v3.19.04: Two bugs fixed:
            BUG 1 — Double always-last for flat folders.
            Root cause: scan_for_numbered_subfolders populates the synthetic
            numbered_folders[1.0] flat entry BEFORE the root-level always_last
            scan runs. The root scan fires (if numbered_folders is truthy),
            finds the same always_last files, and puts them in root_always_last
            too. In main(), both the subfolder pool AND root_always_last are
            played → two always_last files per output.
            FIX: _is_flat_scan flag detects when numbered_folders contains only
            the synthetic 1.0 key with no real F-prefixed subdirs. Root scan
            gated as `if numbered_folders and not _is_flat_scan`.
            BUG 2 — Manifest "Ends at" times ignored chat insert duration.
            Chat files (post-loop splice) can add 30s-10min to chosen files.
            all_file_info_with_times was NOT updated after chat splice, so
            manifest showed pre-chat end times.
            FIX: after each successful chat splice, update all_file_info_with_times
            entries whose filename matches the spliced file by adding _cdur.
- v3.19.03: Fix inef manifest "Ends at" times off by massive pause duration.
            ROOT CAUSE: The split_time used to decide which file end-times need
            correction was read AFTER insert_massive_pause already shifted it
            forward by massive_pause_ms. So split_time = pre_split + pause_ms,
            meaning ALL actual file end-times (which are pre-shift values) were
            less than split_time → zero files corrected → every "Ends at" in an
            inef manifest was wrong by exactly the massive pause duration (~4-7min
            x mult, typically 8-21 minutes for a 2x multiplier).
            FIX: capture split_time_pre_shift before calling insert_massive_pause
            by reading stringed_events[split_idx]['Time'] on the returned split_idx
            then subtracting massive_pause_ms to recover the pre-shift value.
            Condition changed from > to >= (the split point event itself shifts).
- v3.19.02: Part C zero-gap protection — any button-down after button event.
            Parts A and B left gaps: LeftUp→LeftDown, DragEnd→LeftDown,
            LeftUp→DragStart, RightUp→RightDown, ButtonDown→ButtonDown.
            All < 200ms button-event→button-down gaps shifted to 200ms min.
            DragEnd→DragStart skipped in Part C (already handled by Part B).
- v3.19.01: Chat insert reworked — post-loop, all file types eligible.
            After ALL versions are saved for a folder, collect every strung
            .json file, pick floor(total * 0.20) at random (raw included),
            and splice one random chat file into each via read→insert→write-back.
- v3.19.00: Chat insert rate changed from 1 fixed file per batch to exactly
            floor(versions * 0.20) files per batch (20%, rounded down).
            Examples: 10 versions → 2 chat files; 22 versions → 4 chat files;
            5 versions → 1 chat file; 4 versions → 0 chat files.
            chat_version_idx (single int) replaced by chat_version_indices (set)
            built by rng.sample() from the non-raw version pool so selections
            are always unique. Each selected version gets a different random
            chat file (drawn independently). Splice check updated to
            `if v_idx in chat_version_indices`. Display + docstrings updated.
- v3.18.99: 5-slot logout sequence (0-close → 1-logout → 2-wait → 3-relogin → 4-open).
            build_logout_sequence() now detects two extra optional slots:
              slot 0: file whose name contains 'close' or starts with '0-'
              slot 4: file whose name contains 'open'  or starts with '4-'
            If present they wrap the existing 1→2→3 sequence:
              0 → buf → 1 → buf → 2 → random_wait → buf → 3 → buf → 4
            If absent (old 3-file folders) behaviour is unchanged.
            Both slots are optional — any combination of 3, 4, or 5 files works.
            Also added to fixed-file copy list in main() so the 5-slot combined
            file "- 01234 Proper logout+wait+RELOGIN.json" is copied to each
            output folder alongside the existing fixed files.
- v3.18.98: Fix click-target accuracy at cycle boundaries (click-tile misfire fix).
            ROOT CAUSE: The inter-cycle cursor transition (between cycle N end and
            cycle N+1 start) used [:-1] to skip the path's final destination point,
            but never added an explicit SNAP to the exact target position. This left
            the cursor at the penultimate path waypoint — close but not exactly on
            the click target. For raw/normal files with a 500-800ms gap and ~5 path
            steps, the cursor could be 60-120ms and several pixels away from the
            target tile when the DragStart fires → click registers on adjacent tile.
            The WITHIN-cycle transition (between F1→F2 files) already had a correct
            explicit snap + 80-150ms POST-SNAP GAP. That pattern was missing from
            the between-cycle path.
            FIX A — raw/normal inter-cycle: after the path waypoints, add an explicit
            snap MouseMove at (_ic_first_x, _ic_first_y) timestamped at
            _ic_base + _cycle_gap - _IC_SNAP_ADVANCE (where _IC_SNAP_ADVANCE is a
            flat 50ms buffer so the snap lands safely before the new cycle starts).
            FIX B — inef inter-cycle drift: same snap pattern, timestamped at
            _trans_base + inter_cycle_pause - _IC_SNAP_ADVANCE, so the cursor
            settles on the target well before the cycle offset.
            FIX C — generate_human_path: remove 'swift' from transition style pool.
            Swift uses linear constant-speed movement with zero deceleration near
            the target, maximising the gap between penultimate and final points.
            It is kept in distraction files (via _add_mouse_wander etc.) where
            precision does not matter. Transition paths now use only efficient,
            meandering, and hesitant — all of which decelerate near the end.
- v3.18.97: Fix group folder detection for plain-numbered children (Feature 42 bugfix 2).
            Root cause: _has_f_subfolders only matched the strict "F+digit" prefix
            pattern. Group children named "1- withdraw", "2- use" (no F prefix)
            were not detected, so _looks_like_group returned False for organizers
            like "6- smithing files" → fell through to normal scan → merged 61 and
            62 into one output instead of two separate folders.
            Fix: replace single heuristic with two-condition check:
              1. Parent has NO direct F+digit children (if it does, it is a normal
                 macro folder, not a group — catches FM+COOK, 22- Craft Dia, etc.).
              2. At least one direct child has numbered subdirectories (F+digit OR
                 plain digit prefix — catches "1- withdraw" style naming).
            This correctly identifies: Test/ → group, 6-smithing/ → group,
            FM+COOK/ → macro, 22- Craft Dia/ → macro.
- v3.18.96: Fix group folder detection (Feature 42 bugfix).
            Root cause: scan_for_numbered_subfolders extracts any digit from
            a directory name as a subfolder number (fallback regex). Folders
            like test1, test2, tes3 are extracted as subfolders 1, 2, 3 of the
            parent, making the parent look like a macro folder instead of a group.
            Fix: add _looks_like_group(folder) pre-check BEFORE calling
            scan_for_numbered_subfolders. A folder is a group if ANY direct child
            contains a sub-directory whose name starts with F+digit (the canonical
            F-subfolder convention). When true, bypass the normal scan and go
            straight to group/child processing.
            Also: group children that themselves contain only non-F-numbered
            sub-directories (like test2 with straight spot.../f1/file.json) are
            handled by a second heuristic pass that looks one extra level deep
            for the F-prefix pattern.
- v3.18.95: GROUP FOLDER support (Feature 42).
            Organizer folders one level above macros are now fully supported.
            Structure: input_macros/GroupName/Macro1, Macro2, ...
            Selecting a group name runs ALL children, each as its own output.
            Children also remain individually selectable by their own name.
            Duplicate group selection = independent repeat runs of all children.
            ALL FOLDERS mode: group children auto-flatten into the scan.
- v3.18.94: Three fixes:
            1. MANIFEST END-TIME ACCURACY: file "Ends at" timestamps in the
               manifest now reflect the actual play-out time including all
               features that shift event times (within-file pause + mid-event
               pause). Previously, end times were captured inside string_cycle()
               BEFORE apply_cycle_features ran, so they were stale by however
               much pause was added later in the cycle.
               FIX: insert_intra_file_pauses() now returns a 3-tuple
               (events, pause_duration, pivot_raw_time). apply_cycle_features()
               collects pause_pivots = [(raw_pivot_t, amount)] for both the
               intra-file pause and the mid-event pause. In main(), before
               recording actual_end_time, each file end time is corrected by
               summing amounts for all pivots whose raw_t <= file's raw end.
               Jitter and idle do not shift event times (only insert new ones)
               and are correctly excluded from pivot tracking.
            2. OVERLAP / JITTER / CLICK INTEGRITY verified (no new code bug
               found beyond Part B fix in v3.18.92/93). Confirmed:
               - Jitter exclusion zone (±1000ms) covers all click types.
               - Intra pause and mid-event pause both exclude press events
                 and rapid-click protected ranges.
               - Inter-cycle transition MM at t=DragEnd_time is safe (button
                 released, then cursor departs — correct sequence order).
            3. DUPLICATE FOLDER clarity: shallow-copy on non-sf-filter path
               now documented; _run_suffix is isolated per copy.
- v3.18.93: Two new features:
            1. DUPLICATE FOLDER SUPPORT: selecting the same folder in multiple
               dropdown slots now produces one independent output folder per
               selection. The 2nd occurrence is named "(N) FolderName (2)", the
               3rd "(N) FolderName (3)", etc. Each run uses its own RNG state so
               the file combinations differ between copies.
               Implementation: entries_list ordered list replaces the old entries
               dict; _run_suffix added to each folder_data for output naming.
            2. LOGOUT SHORT BREAK + LONG BREAK files (old RANDOM BREAK retired).
               build_logout_sequence() gains wait_range_ms=(lo, hi) parameter.
               Called twice per output folder with a fresh unseeded RNG each call:
               Long:  (7200000, 16200000) ms = 2h – 4.5h
               Short: (1800000,  5400000) ms = 30min – 90min
               Waits are float ms, never rounded, different every folder+run.
- v3.18.92: Part B threshold raised 150ms → 200ms (drag clamp fix).
- v3.18.85: Rapid-click protection hardening:
            1. insert_intra_file_pauses: extended pause-point exclusion from DragStart-only
               to ALL press/release types (LeftDown, LeftUp, RightDown, RightUp, Click,
               DragStart). Prevents pauses landing AT or immediately BEFORE any click
               event, which could stretch click-hold duration or desync rapid sequences.
            2. apply_cycle_features mid-event pause (Step 3b): same exclusion expansion,
               so the multiplier-driven random pause also cannot corrupt click timing.
            3. add_pre_click_jitter: added LeftUp and RightUp to the click_types exclusion
               set so the 1000ms jitter-free zone anchors to release events as well.
            4. detect_rapid_click_sequences: added MouseDown/MouseUp as recognised aliases
               alongside LeftDown/LeftUp — defensive coding for source files that use
               different event-type naming conventions.
- v3.18.84: Two new diagnostic features:
            1. Short-file manifest flag: any source file whose raw duration is under 500ms
               is flagged with '????????' suffix in the manifest (e.g. "W62s (3).json ????????").
               Does NOT affect always_first/last files (those are intentionally short).
               Threshold: < 500ms raw duration (before any features are applied).
            2. SEQUENCE REUSED folder tag: when the 500-attempt combination fallback fires
               (pool exhausted), the output folder is prefixed with "SEQUENCE REUSED " so the
               operator can immediately see which runs had a depleted file pool.
               e.g. "(329) Cook straight spot" -> "(329) SEQUENCE REUSED Cook straight spot"
               Also prints a console warning line during processing.
- v3.18.83: Two fixes + one new distraction feature:
            1. MANIFEST FIX — Total Original Files was always 0 for doubly-nested
               folders (e.g. FM+COOK where F1/F2 are nested, not flat).
               Root cause: counting loop only looked at _subfolder_data['files'],
               which is [] for nested slots; files live inside nested_subfolder_files.
               Fix: _count_files_recursive() helper descends into nested_subfolder_files
               at all levels. Applied to both main() copies.
            2. New distraction feature: backspace-hold (Feature 31 addition).
               _add_backspace_hold() holds Backspace for rng.uniform(1000, 3000) ms
               — float ms, never rounded. Simulates a player absent-mindedly holding
               Backspace. Added to ACTION_WEIGHTS (weight 10) in both
               generate_distraction_files copies. Dispatch wired in both copies.
               Feature docstring (Feature 31) updated to list 7 features.
- v3.18.82: Fixed nested-folder combination signature bug causing only 1 cycle to run.
            SCENARIO: main folder where EVERY direct subfolder is a nested folder
            (e.g. F1=FM cycle, F2=Cook cycle, each with their own inner F1-FN).
            BUG: the signature builder in ManualHistoryTracker.get_next_combination
            (and in the outer combo_signature loop) used:
              fp.name if hasattr(fp, 'name') else f"nested_{i}"
            Nested combo dicts don't have .name → every combination produced
            "F1=nested_0|F2=nested_0" regardless of which inner files were picked.
            After the FIRST cycle, this signature was added to used_combinations.
            All 499 remaining max_attempts produced the same signature → all
            rejected → get_next_combination returned None after 1 cycle → while
            loop broke → ~3 minutes of content → 1 short output file instead of 12.
            FIX: new helper _combo_fp_sig(fp, i) recursively extracts actual inner
            filenames from nested combo dicts, producing unique signatures like
            "F1=N(fm_f1.json+fm_f2.json+...)|F2=N(cook_f1.json+cook_f2.json+...)".
            Applied to all 3 signature-building sites (both ManualHistoryTracker
            copies + outer loop in main()). _combo_fp_sig is a module-level function
            inserted once (first-copy position) and available to both copies.
- v3.18.81: Fixed double-click protection gap in detect_rapid_click_sequences.
            BUG: the detection set only included 'Click' and 'DragStart'. Source
            recordings that use native LeftDown/LeftUp events (instead of the
            high-level 'Click' type) were invisible to the rapid-click detector.
            The intra-file pause (Step 3) and mid-event pause (Step 3b) could
            therefore pick a point between two LeftDown events in a rapid sequence,
            widening the gap from the recorded ~200ms to 1000ms+ and breaking the
            double-click pattern. Confirmed: 109/500 random seeds broke the gap.
            FIX: detection set expanded to include LeftDown, LeftUp, RightDown,
            RightUp. Both copies updated. The protected range still covers the full
            first→last span of the sequence, blocking any pause insertion inside it.
            After fix: 0/500 seeds break the gap.
- v3.18.80: Two changes:
            1. Docstring "Current version:" now matches VERSION (was stuck at v3.18.59).
               Updated to v3.18.80 and will be kept in sync going forward.
            2. New Feature 41 — Same-number folder pooling.
               Multiple physical subfolders sharing the same F-number are merged into
               one logical cycle slot. Files, always_first/last pools, and boolean tags
               (optional/end/time-sensitive/click-sensitive) are OR-combined. Scalar
               tags (optional_chance, max_files) use the first non-None value found.
               Nested subfolder dicts are merged by inner slot number.
               Implemented in scan_for_numbered_subfolders (both copies): instead of
               overwriting numbered_folders[folder_num], checks if the key exists and
               merges. Prints "[Pool] FN: merged 'name' (X files total)" per merge.
- v3.18.79: Extended intra-file zero-gap fix (Feature 25) with Part B:
            DragEnd -> DragStart pairs with a gap under 150ms are now shifted
            to enforce a 200ms minimum separation.
            ROOT CAUSE: source recordings contain rapid drag re-presses (52-130ms
            apart, always at identical coordinates). The macro player cannot
            distinguish a genuine button release + re-click from a single held
            drag in that time window, causing left-button clamp.
            Part A (MouseMove -> click-type < 15ms → 20ms) is unchanged.
            Part B is a second independent loop that runs after Part A on the
            same raw event list, before any features are applied.
            Confirmed: strung file had 16 DragEnd->DragStart pairs under 150ms
            (min 52ms); all are caught and shifted by Part B.
- v3.18.78: Fixed click-sensitive flag silently falling through as False in the outer loop.
            ROOT CAUSE: folder_is_click_sensitive was computed purely from subfolder dicts:
              any(fd.get('is_click_sensitive', False) for fd in subfolder_files.values())
            If the subfolder dicts lacked the flag (e.g. from an older scan code path or
            a specific-folders filter edge case), the check returned False even for folders
            whose name contains 'click sensitive'/'click+time sensitive' etc.
            EFFECT: for click-sensitive folders, BOTH jitter and cursor transitions were
            applied to cycle content when they should be suppressed. Confirmed via data:
            57 always_first events showed ±1-3px jitter shifts, and 2 cursor transition
            path events appeared before the always_first start in the strung file. The
            mis-placed cursor events caused the DragStart to fire over an unexpected
            screen position → left-click button clamp.
            FIX: belt-and-suspenders — folder_is_click_sensitive now ALSO checks
            folder_name directly for any click-sensitive tag (same 4 patterns as the
            scanner). Name check || subfolder-dict check, so either alone suffices.
- v3.18.77: Two bug fixes:
            1. NameError in inter-cycle transition block (v3.18.75 regression):
               outer loop uses 'folder_is_click_sensitive' but the block wrote
               'is_click_sensitive' (the parameter name inside string_cycle).
               Fixed: changed to 'folder_is_click_sensitive' in the outer loop.
            2. LOGOUT wait time was identical across runs for the same bundle ID
               because _lo_rng was seeded with (bundle_id + 31337). Changed to
               random.Random() (unseeded, system entropy) so every run produces
               a genuinely different wait duration for the idle file.
- v3.18.76: New Feature 40 — LOGOUT sequence folder ('LOGOUT, wait, in').
            Replaces the static '- logout.json' file with a strung 3-file
            sequence: proper logout -> idle wait (1min-3hrs random) -> relogin.
            build_logout_sequence() function added (both copies). Detection
            runs before the main scan; LOGOUT folder is skipped in scan loop.
            Uses a dedicated rng (bundle_id + 31337) seeded independently.
- v3.18.75: Fixed two inter-cycle cursor transition bugs causing teleports between cycles.
            BUG 1 (all non-click-sensitive types): Block-1 ran for inef files AND for
            raw/normal. For inef, it immediately moved the cursor to the destination in
            ~500-800ms. Block-2 then found distance≈0 between last and first positions
            → generate_human_path returned a single point → path[:-1] was empty → zero
            drift events during the 10-30s inef pause. The teleport was still visible
            at the start of the next cycle.
            FIX: Block-1 now skips inef files (`and not is_inef`). Inef transition is
            handled entirely by block-2 which covers the full 10-30s with a slow drift.
            BUG 2 (inef only): Block-2 used `_trans_base = stringed_events[-1]['Time']`.
            When idle-movement events extended stringed_events beyond current_duration,
            this base was too late — drift events started mid-pause and the last ones
            landed past the next cycle's content start, overlapping after sort.
            FIX: Block-2 now uses `_trans_base = current_duration` — the true end of
            the previous cycle's content — anchoring the drift exactly at the boundary.
- v3.18.46: ESC key (KeyCode 27) removed from filter_problematic_keys.
            ESC was being stripped from every source file on load because macro
            players use ESC to stop playback. However ESC is also a valid in-game
            action (e.g. closing menus, cancelling dialogs) and must be preserved.
            Remaining filtered keys: HOME(36), END(35), PAGE_UP(33), PAGE_DOWN(34),
            PAUSE(19), PRINT_SCREEN(44) — these have no in-game use and reliably
            break or freeze macro playback.
- v3.18.45: Pre-play buffer now also fires between cycles (all file types).
            ROOT CAUSE of click-through bug: add_file_to_cycle fires a 500-800ms
            buffer between files WITHIN a cycle (when files_added > 0). But at
            the boundary between cycle N and cycle N+1, files_added resets to 0
            for the first file of the new cycle — no buffer fires. This left the
            last DragEnd of cycle N and the cursor transition start of cycle N+1
            at the exact same timestamp (0ms gap). The game reads simultaneous
            DragEnd + MouseMove as cursor still held -> drag-click at wrong coords.
            Fix: in the outer loop, if stringed_events is non-empty (not first cycle),
            add a rng.uniform(500,800)ms gap to inter_cycle_pause for ALL file types
            before appending the next cycle. Tracked in total_pre_file.
- v3.18.44: Flat/single-subfolder always_first/last now wraps whole strung file.
            Previously string_cycle played always_first/last on EVERY cycle call,
            so a 50-cycle file had 50x [ALWAYS FIRST]...[ALWAYS LAST] pairs.
            Fix: outer loop passes play_always_first=True only on cycle 0, and
            suppresses play_always_last entirely. After the while loop, always_last
            is injected once directly into stringed_events with a pre-play buffer.
            Result: [ALWAYS FIRST] -> file_1 -> file_2 -> ... -> file_N -> [ALWAYS LAST]
- v3.18.43: CRITICAL — end tag now uses word-boundary matching.
            BUG: 'end' in folder_name was a substring check. Any folder name
            containing a word with "end" in it (e.g. "click tend", "blend",
            "extended") was being tagged as an END folder, causing the loop to
            stop there and skip all subsequent folders.
            Example: "F4- use log on fire OR click tend" matched because
            "t-END" contains "end" -> loop stopped at F4, F5 and F6 ignored.
            FIX: changed to re.search(r'\bend\b', ...) — whole-word match only.
            "tend" no longer matches. "end", "end-logout", "optional+end" still do.
- v3.18.42: Two fixes:
            1. optional+end tag renamed from "optional/end" everywhere in docs,
               comments, print output, and manifest. Tag detection unchanged
               (still looks for both "optional" AND "end" in folder name).
            2. All combination.append() calls now consistently wrap the file in
               a list [_f] — the optional+end branch, end branch, and fallback
               path were appending raw Path objects. string_cycle has an
               isinstance guard that handled it safely, but this makes the
               contract explicit and removes the inconsistency.
- v3.18.41: always_first/last in multi-subfolder mode now wraps ONLY the files
            of their own folder, then continues to remaining folders.
            Pattern: [ALWAYS FIRST] -> F0 files -> [ALWAYS LAST] -> F1 -> F2 -> ...
            Previously wrapped the entire cycle (all folders). Also fixed file
            corruption from emoji-stripping pass (ohno_pause variable, prefix docs).
- v3.18.39: click sensitive main-folder tag now propagates to all subfolders
- v3.18.38: click sensitive also skips distraction file insertion
- v3.18.37: click sensitive fully implemented (jitter + idle + transitions all skipped)
- v3.18.36: inef massive pause pre-sampled so total file stays near target duration
- v3.18.35: safety file-count limit raised 150->2000 (was cutting files short)
- v3.18.34: subfolder number extraction prefers F<N> prefix; optional-chance
            regex excludes dashes so -2- max-files marker not read as 2%
- v3.18.33: always_first/last wraps once per cycle; bundle ID moved to prefix;
            dedup by filename globally; subfolder counts in manifest
- v3.18.32: time-sensitive 1:1 ratio; click-sensitive tag; max-files tag;
            copied folder dedup; subfolder counts
- v3.18.31: virtual queue for all subfolder files; post-pause delay deleted;
            distraction in manifest; massive pause 4-7 min; within-file %
- v3.18.30: intra-file zero-gap protection (Feature 35)
- v3.18.29: virtual queue for distraction files; 2:3:7 ratio distribution

    - Double clicks (2 clicks within 500ms, +/-20 pixels)
    - Spam clicks  (3+ clicks within 2 seconds, +/-20 pixels)

    Detection set: Click, DragStart, LeftDown, LeftUp, RightDown, RightUp.
    LeftDown/LeftUp are included because source files often use native button
    events instead of the high-level 'Click' type. Without them, a LeftDown
    double-click sequence could have a pause inserted between the two presses,
    widening the inter-click gap from ~200ms to 1000ms+ and ruining the pattern.

    The protected range covers the ENTIRE span from the first to the last event
    in the sequence, including any intermediate LeftUp / MouseMove events,
    so no pause can land inside the double-click window.

    Returns list of protected ranges: [(start_idx, end_idx), ...]
    These ranges should NOT have pauses/gaps inserted between them.

                     DETECTED FOLDER & FILE TAGS
===========================================================================

FOLDER TAGS (detected in folder name, case-insensitive):
  - "optional"        -> Folder has 24-33% chance to be included per run
  - "end"             -> Folder becomes definitive loop endpoint (stops after)
  - "optional+end"    -> Combination: optional folder that ends loop IF chosen
  - "time sensitive"  -> No inefficient files generated (replaced with normal files)
                        Can be applied to:
                        - Main folder -> ALL subfolders become time_sensitive
                        - Individual subfolders -> Only that subfolder is time_sensitive
  - "(random)"        -> F-step folder with sub-subfolders. Each cycle: picks exactly
                        1 file from ALL sub-subfolders in freshly randomised order.
                        Sub-subfolders detected by leading digit OR bracketed number:
                          'drop sword (1)', 'drop shield (2)', '3- drop helm' all work.
  - "(randomN)"       -> Same as (random) but picks from only N randomly chosen
                        sub-subfolders per cycle. Example: (random10) with 28 folders
                        picks 10 different folders each cycle, shuffled, 1 file each.
                        N resets each cycle — no repeat guarantee across cycles.
  - (Decimal support: "3.5" goes between folders 3 and 4)

FILE TAGS (detected in filename, case-insensitive):
  - "always first" or "alwaysfirst"  -> File always plays first in its folder
  - "always last" or "alwayslast"    -> File always plays last in its folder

SPECIAL FOLDER (exact name match, case-insensitive):
  - "Don't use features on me" -> Files inserted unmodified (no features applied)
  - (Also accepts old name "dont mess with me" for backward compatibility)

                    GROUP 1: PAUSE BREAKS (Anti-Detection Timing)
===========================================================================

These features add natural pauses and delays to prevent robotic timing patterns.

1. WITHIN FILE PAUSES
   Status: [OK] ACTIVE (Normal and Inefficient files only)
   Old Name: "Intra-file pauses"
   What: A single pause inserted at a safe point inside each individual file.
         Duration is a PERCENTAGE of that file's own play time - so longer files
         get proportionally longer pauses.
   Values by File Type:
     - Raw:         0%  - no pause inserted
     - Normal:      5%  - e.g. 20s file -> 1.0s pause
     - Inefficient: 15% - e.g. 20s file -> 3.0s pause
   Safe Location: Middle 80% of file only; never inside drag sequences, never
                  inside rapid-click sequences, never immediately before DragStart.
   Duration: float ms (no rounding) = file_duration_ms x percentage
   Purpose: Natural hesitation that scales with file length
   Code: insert_intra_file_pauses() with file_type parameter
   Manifest: "Within File Pauses: Xm Xs"

2. PRE-PLAY BUFFER
   Status: [OK] ACTIVE (Always, all file types)
   Old Name: "Pre-file pauses"
   What: Fixed pause BEFORE each file starts playing
   Duration: 800ms (0.8 seconds) - FLAT, NO multiplier, NO randomization
   When: Applied BEFORE cursor movement (click release protection)
   Purpose: Ensures clicks from previous file are fully released
   Code: Line ~1376-1384 (pre_file_pause)
   Total Impact: ~2m 40s per 50-minute output (200 files x 800ms)
   Manifest: "PRE-Play Buffer: Xm Xs"
   Order: PRE-pause -> Cursor transition -> File plays

3. INEFFICIENT BEFORE FILE PAUSE
   Status: [OK] ACTIVE (Inefficient files ONLY, file >= 25 seconds)
   Old Name: "Before File Pause" or "Inter-file pauses" or "Between cycles pause"
   What: Longer pause between complete action cycles
   Duration: 10-30 seconds (10000-30000ms, random, NOT rounded, NO multiplier)
   File Length Check: Only applied if file duration >= 25 seconds
   File Types:
     - Raw: [X] DISABLED
     - Inefficient: [OK] ACTIVE (if file >= 25s)
     - Normal: [X] DISABLED
   Purpose: Major break between action sequences
   Code: Line ~2084-2093 (inter_cycle_pause with file length check)
   Manifest: "INEFFICIENT Before File Pause: Xm Xs"


5. INEFFICIENT MASSIVE PAUSE
   Status: [OK] ACTIVE (Inefficient files ONLY)
   Old Name: "Massive pause"
   What: One random pause inserted at safe location
   Duration: 4-7 minutes (240000-420000ms, random, NOT rounded) x multiplier
   Examples: x2.0 = 8-14 min | x3.0 = 12-21 min
   Safe Location Detection: EXCLUDES pause from:
     - Drag sequences (between DragStart and DragEnd)
     - Rapid click sequences (double-clicks, spam clicks)
     - First/last 10% of file (for safety)
     - Immediately BEFORE DragStart events (FIX v3.15.2)
   Where: Random safe point in middle 80% of file
   File Types:
     - Raw: [X] NOT USED
     - Inefficient: [OK] INSERTED
     - Normal: [X] NOT USED
   Purpose: Simulates AFK/distracted behavior
   Code: Line ~1171-1220 (insert_massive_pause with drag protection)
   Manifest: "INEFFICIENT MASSIVE PAUSE: Xm Xs"
   
   BUG FIX (v3.15.2): Added check to prevent pause insertion immediately before
   DragStart events. Previously, pauses could be inserted right before DragStart,
   which shifted the DragEnd forward in time, making clicks appear to last 1-4
   seconds instead of <150ms, causing drag/clamp issues.

6. MULTIPLIER SYSTEM
   Status: [OK] ACTIVE (Always)
   What: Scales all pause durations by multiplier value
   Values by File Type (UPDATED v3.13.0):
     Raw Files:
       - x1.0 (50% probability)
       - x1.1 (50% probability)
     
     Normal Files:
       - x1.3 (65% probability)
       - x1.5 (35% probability)
     
     Inefficient Files:
       - x2.0 (60% probability)
       - x3.0 (40% probability)
   
   Purpose: Varied timing patterns across output files
   Code: Line ~1918-1927 (multiplier selection)
   Manifest: "(xN Multiplier)" shown in each file header

===========================================================================
              GROUP 2: PATTERN BREAKING (Anti-Detection Variance)
===========================================================================

These features add variation and unpredictability to prevent detectable patterns.

1. CURSOR TO START POINT
   Status: [OK] ACTIVE (Skipped for click-sensitive folders)
   Old Name: "Cursor transitions"
   What: Smooth cursor movement from file end position to next file start
   Duration: 200-400ms per transition (varies by path style)
   Path Styles (random per transition):
     - Efficient: Direct path, few curves, faster
     - Swift: Very fast, straight line
     - Meandering: Curved path, more wandering
     - Hesitant: Slow start, acceleration, deceleration
   Speed Variations: Very fast (100-200ms) to Very slow (700-1000ms)
   Purpose: No mouse teleportation; realistic cursor flow with variety
   Code: Line ~498-576 (generate_human_path with path styles)
   Impact: Adds ~30-35s to 50-minute output
   Manifest: "CURSOR to Start Point: Xm Xs"
   Note: This DOES add time to total duration (intentional)

2. IDLE CURSOR WANDERING
   Status: [OK] ACTIVE (Always, during pauses > 1s)
   Old Name: "Idle mouse movements"
   What: Small random mouse wiggles during long pauses
   When: Any pause > 1 second
   Pattern: Smooth Bezier curves, realistic speed
   Purpose: Cursor doesn't stay frozen during waits
   Code: Line ~702-793 (add_idle_movements)
   Impact: ~7-11 minutes "movement time" per 50-min output
   Manifest: "Idle Mouse Movements: Xm Xs"
   Note: This does NOT extend file duration (happens during existing pauses)

3. MOUSE JITTER
   Status: [OK] ACTIVE (9-21% of movements, with exclusions)
   What: Random small offsets to cursor positions
   Percentage: 9-21% of all mouse movements get jittered
   Amount: Small random offset per movement
   Exclusion Zones (NO JITTER):
     - 1000ms before/after any click
     - 1500ms for rapid click sequences (3+ clicks in 1500ms)
     - During drag operations (hold + move + release)
   Purpose: Natural hand tremor, but maintains click accuracy
   Code: Line ~669-677 (apply_smart_jitter)
   Protection: Line ~552-589 (detect rapid clicks)
   Note: DISABLED near clicks to prevent off-target clicks
   Manifest: "Mouse Jitter: XX%"

4. RANDOM FILE QUEUE
   Status: [OK] ACTIVE (Always)
   What: Files selected randomly from each folder per cycle
   Method: Random choice from available files
   Avoids: Repeating same folder combination (via history)
   Purpose: No predictable file order
   Code: Line ~1475 (rng.choice for file selection)
   Manifest: File order visible in manifest list

===========================================================================
            GROUP 3: ENSURING SMOOTH OPERATION (Reliability)

   Purpose: Prevents jitter from breaking rapid action sequences
   Code: Line ~552-589 (detect_rapid_click_sequences)

2. DRAG OPERATION PROTECTION
   Status: [OK] ACTIVE (Always)
   What: Detects drag operations and prevents jitter during them
   Detection: Hold + Move + Release patterns
   Protection: NO jitter during entire drag sequence
   Purpose: Maintains drag accuracy
   Code: Line ~596-628 (detect_drag_operations)

3. EVENT TIMING INTEGRITY PROTECTION
   Status: [OK] ACTIVE (Always, all time-adding features)
   What: Prevents pauses/modifications from interfering with drag/click timing
   Protection Zones (NO time modification):
     - Between DragStart and DragEnd pairs
     - Immediately BEFORE DragStart events
     - Within rapid click sequences
     - First/last 10% of file
   Impact: Maintains click responsiveness (<200ms), prevents drag/clamp issues
   Purpose: CRITICAL protection to prevent clicks being held 1-4 seconds
   Code: Line ~1171-1220 (insert_massive_pause with protection)
   Added: v3.15.2 (bug fix for click timing)

4. COMBINATION HISTORY
   Status: [OK] ACTIVE (Always)
   What: Tracks which folder combinations have been used
   Prevents: Repeating same combination across cycles
   Tracking: "F1=file01.json|F2=file05.json|F3=file12.json"
   File: COMBINATION_HISTORY_XX.txt (created per bundle)
   Purpose: Maximum variety across runs
   Code: Line ~1380-1510 (ManualHistoryTracker class)

5. MANUAL HISTORY UPLOAD
   Status: [OK] ACTIVE (If files present)
   What: Upload old combination files to avoid repeating them
   Location: input_macros/combination_history/
   Reads: All .txt files automatically
   Purpose: Never repeat across multiple runs/sessions
   Code: Line ~1410-1450 (load history from folder)

6. ALPHABETICAL NAMING
   Status: [OK] ACTIVE (Always)
   What: Organized naming convention for output files
   Pattern:
     Raw files:        ^XX_A, ^XX_B, ^XX_C
     Inefficient:      XX_D, XX_E, XX_F (with special prefix)
     Normal:           XX_G, XX_H, XX_I, XX_J, XX_K, XX_L
   Purpose: Easy identification of file type at a glance
   Code: Line ~1940-1980 (filename generation)

7. FOLDER-NUMBER BASED STRUCTURE
   Status: [OK] ACTIVE (Always, supports decimals)
   Old Name: "Folder-based structure"
   What: Folders numbered in sequence; files cycle through them
   Format: "1- action/", "2- bank/", "3.5- optional/", "4- continue/"
   Decimal Support: 3.5 goes after 3 and before 4
   Pattern: F1 -> F2 -> F3 -> F3.5 -> F4 -> F1 -> ...
   Purpose: Maintains sequential action steps
   Code: Line ~1318-1360 (folder number extraction & sorting)

8. 'OPTIONAL' TAGGED FOLDERS
   Status: [OK] ACTIVE (If "optional" in folder name)
   Old Name: "Optional folders"
   Tag Detection: "optional" anywhere in folder name (case-insensitive)
   Behavior: Folder has random chance to be included in each cycle
   Chance (default): 24.0-33.0% random float range (rolled once per bundle, consistent within bundle)
   Custom Chance: Append a number directly to the tag to override the default
     - "optional50%"   -> exactly 50% chance
     - "optional50.5"  -> exactly 50.5% chance  ? decimals supported
     - "optional33.3"  -> exactly 33.3% chance  ? decimals supported
     - "optional10"    -> exactly 10% chance
     - "optional75"    -> exactly 75% chance
     - "optional"      -> default 24.0-33.0% range (no number = use default)
     The number (integer OR decimal) is parsed from the tag; spaces, dashes, and % are ignored.
   Examples:
     "3 optional- bank early/"           -> default 24.0-33.0% chance
     "3 optional50- bank early/"         -> exactly 50.0% chance
     "3 optional50.5- bank early/"       -> exactly 50.5% chance
     "3 optional50%- bank early/"        -> exactly 50.0% chance
     "3 optional10- rare action/"        -> exactly 10.0% chance
   Purpose: Unpredictable action path variations with per-folder probability control
   Code: Line ~1442 (is_optional detection + parse_optional_chance())

9. 'END' TAGGED FOLDERS
   Status: [OK] ACTIVE (If "end" in folder name)
   Tag Detection: "end" anywhere in folder name (case-insensitive)
   Behavior: Folder becomes definitive loop endpoint (stops after)
   Example: "5 end- logout/"
   Purpose: Controlled endpoint timing
   Code: Line ~1347 (is_end detection)

10. 'OPTIONAL+END' COMBO TAGGED FOLDERS
    Status: [OK] ACTIVE (If both "optional" and "end" in name)
    Tag Detection: Both "optional" AND "end" in folder name
    Behavior: 
      - Chance to include folder (same custom % syntax as Feature 8)
      - IF included: Loop stops at this folder
      - IF skipped: Loop continues to next folders
    Examples:
      "3.5 optional+end- early bank/"      -> default 24.0-33.0% chance
      "3.5 optional50/end- early bank/"    -> exactly 50.0% chance
      "3.5 optional50.5/end- early bank/" -> exactly 50.5% chance
    Purpose: Sometimes end early, sometimes continue full loop
    Code: Line ~1448-1462 (is_optional_end handling)

11. 'TIME SENSITIVE' TAGGED FOLDERS
    Status: [OK] ACTIVE (If "time sensitive" in folder name)
    New Feature: v3.13.0 | Enhanced: v3.14.2 | Ratio updated: v3.18.32
    Tag Detection: "time sensitive" anywhere in folder name (case-insensitive)
    Behavior: NO inefficient files generated; 1:1 raw:normal ratio
    
    Two Application Modes:
      A) MAIN FOLDER TAGGED:
         Example: "61- Mining TIME SENSITIVE/"
                    ??? 1- setup/
                    ??? 2- mine/
                    ??? 3- bank/
         Result: ALL subfolders (1, 2, 3) become time_sensitive
         
      B) INDIVIDUAL SUBFOLDER TAGGED:
         Example: "61- Mining/"
                    ??? 1- setup/
                    ??? 2 time sensitive- mine/  ? Only this one
                    ??? 3- bank/
         Result: Only subfolder 2 is time_sensitive
    
    File Distribution Changes:
      - Regular folder: 2 Raw + 3 Inef + 7 Normal = 12 files (2:3:7 ratio)
      - Time sensitive: 6 Raw + 0 Inef + 6 Normal = 12 files (1:1 ratio)
    
    Priority: Main folder tag overrides individual subfolder tags
    Purpose: Activities requiring consistent timing (combat, PvP, timed tasks)
    Code: scan_for_numbered_subfolders() - main_folder_time_sensitive propagation
    Note: Entire bundle affected if ANY folder is time_sensitive

26. 'CLICK SENSITIVE' TAGGED FOLDERS
    Status: [OK] ACTIVE (If "click sensitive" in folder name)
    Added: v3.18.32 | Fixed propagation: v3.18.39
    Tag Detection: "click sensitive" anywhere in folder or main folder name (case-insensitive)
    Behavior: ALL coordinate-changing features are disabled for this folder.
    Features DISABLED when click-sensitive:
      - Cursor transition path between files (no human-path movements)
      - Mouse jitter (no random coord offsets)
      - Idle cursor wandering (no movements during pauses)
      - Distraction file insertion (distractions also move the cursor)
    Features STILL ACTIVE:
      - Within-file pauses (time-based, no coord changes)
      - Pre-play buffer (timing only)
      - Rapid click detection / drag protection
    
    Two Application Modes:
      A) MAIN FOLDER TAGGED:
         Example: "18- WC- draynor CLICK SENSITIVE/"
         Result: ALL subfolders skip coordinate-changing features
      B) INDIVIDUAL SUBFOLDER TAGGED:
         Example: "18- WC- draynor/"
                    ??? 2 click sensitive- click tree/
         Result: Only subfolder 2 is click-sensitive
    
    Accepted tag variants (all case-insensitive):
      "click sensitive", "click/time sensitive", "click+time sensitive"
    Purpose: Activities where cursor must stay at exact recorded coordinates
             (e.g. fishing spots, precise clicks, inventory management)
    Code: scan_for_numbered_subfolders(), apply_cycle_features(), string_cycle()

27. 'CLICK/TIME SENSITIVE' COMBO TAG
    Status: [OK] ACTIVE (Combines both tag rules)
    Added: v3.18.32
    Tag Detection: "click/time sensitive", "click+time sensitive", or
                   "click time sensitive" in folder name (case-insensitive)
    Behavior: Activates BOTH click-sensitive AND time-sensitive rules simultaneously:
      - 1:1 raw:normal ratio (no inefficient files) - from time sensitive
      - No cursor pathing, jitter, idle wandering, distractions - from click sensitive
    Example: "Fishing experimental- click+time sensitive/"
    Purpose: Precision timing activities where coordinates must also be exact

12. 'DON'T USE FEATURES ON ME' TAGGED FOLDERS
    Status: [OK] ACTIVE (If folder name matches)
    Old Name: "DMWM Support" or "dont mess with me"
    Tag Detection: Exact match "Don't use features on me" (case-insensitive)
    Backward Compatible: Also accepts old name "dont mess with me"
    Behavior: Files from this folder inserted completely unmodified
    Features Skipped: NO jitter, NO pauses, NO modifications
    Marked In Manifest: "[UNMODIFIED] filename.json"
    Purpose: Include specific pre-made sequences as-is
    Code: Line ~1433-1441 (folder detection)

13. ALWAYS FIRST/LAST FILES
    Status: [OK] ACTIVE (If tagged in filename)
    Tag Detection: "always first", "alwaysfirst", "always last", "alwayslast"
    Location: In filename (case-insensitive)
    
    Two Modes (auto-detected by folder structure):
    
      A) MULTI-SUBFOLDER MODE (2+ numbered subfolders):
         Original behaviour. always_first/last wrap every selected file, every cycle.
         Pattern per file slot: [ALWAYS FIRST] -> selected file -> [ALWAYS LAST]
         Use case: Opener/closer needed around each action step (e.g. login per step)
    
      B) SINGLE-SUBFOLDER MODE (1 subfolder OR flat folder):
         always_first plays once at the very beginning of the strung file.
         always_last plays once at the very end of the strung file.
         All selected files play in sequence in between.
         Pattern: [ALWAYS FIRST] -> file1 -> file2 -> file3 -> ... -> [ALWAYS LAST]
         Use case: Global opener/closer (e.g. login once, do N actions, logout once)
    
    Examples:
      "setup_always_first.json"   -> plays at start
      "cleanup_alwayslast.json"   -> plays at end
    Purpose: Guaranteed sequence control - either per-file or per-strung-file
    Code: string_cycle() - single_subfolder check before/after combination loop

14. COMPREHENSIVE MANIFEST
    Status: [OK] ACTIVE (Always)
    What: Detailed breakdown showing all timing and features
    Location: __MANIFEST_XX__.txt in output folder
    Shows:
      - All file types and durations
      - Complete pause breakdown by type
      - File list with cumulative timeline
      - Multiplier and jitter percentage
      - Folder structure
    Purpose: Complete transparency and verification
    Code: Line ~1965-2045 (manifest generation)

15. SPECIFIC FOLDERS FILTERING
    Status: ?? OPTIONAL (--specific-folders <file>)
    What: Only process folders listed in file
    Default: Process ALL numbered folders
    Usage: Pass text file with folder numbers (one per line)
    Purpose: Run subset of activities
    Code: Line ~1640-1665 (filtering logic)

16. CHAT INSERTS
    Status: ?? OPTIONAL (Disabled by default, --no-chat flag)
    What: One random chat macro is spliced into exactly one version per folder batch.
    Behaviour:
      - Per folder batch: 1 non-raw version is chosen at random to receive chat
      - That version gets 1 chat file inserted at a random point in its middle third
      - All other versions in the batch get no chat insert
      - Raw files are never chosen (they carry no added features)
      - If no chat files are found in "chat inserts/" folder, nothing happens
    Chat File Location: <input root>/../chat inserts/*.json
    Insertion Point: Random index in middle third of finished strung_events
      After insertion all subsequent event timestamps are shifted forward by
      the chat file's duration so timing integrity is preserved.
    Default: DISABLED in workflows (pass --no-chat to disable explicitly)
    Purpose: Natural social presence - one chat per activity run, unpredictable timing
    Code: chat_version_idx selection before version loop; splice block before save

17. PRE-PLAY BUFFER GUARANTEE (files_added counter)
    Status: [OK] ACTIVE (Always)
    Added: v3.17.2
    What: Guarantees the pre-play buffer (300ms) fires before EVERY file transition,
          including always_first and always_last files.
    Problem It Solved:
      - The original guard was "if cycle_events:" - checking if the events list was
        non-empty to decide whether to insert the buffer.
      - Python's nonlocal binding means if the outer scope ever rebinds cycle_events
        (e.g. cycle_events = []) after the inner function captures it, the inner
        function's nonlocal lookup sees the old empty reference.
      - Result: always_first / always_last files started at 0ms after the previous
        file ended - no buffer, no cursor path. Last click of previous file and first
        click of next file fired on the same millisecond, causing missed actions.
    Fix: Replaced "if cycle_events:" with "if files_added > 0:" using an explicit
         integer counter. Integers cannot be silently rebound the same way as lists.
         Counter is declared in outer scope, accessed via nonlocal, incremented by 1
         after every successful file add.
    Also Fixed: Cursor path condition was "if last_x and first_x" - this silently
                fails when X=0 (a valid screen coordinate, evaluates as falsy in Python).
                Changed to "if last_x is not None and first_x is not None".
    Impact: All file transitions now guaranteed to have:
              File ends -> 500-800ms buffer (random) -> cursor path -> next file starts
    Code: add_file_to_cycle() inner function; files_added init in string_cycle()

18. FAIL-FAST ERROR HANDLING
    Status: [OK] ACTIVE (Always)
    Added: v3.17.1
    What: All fatal early-exit conditions now call sys.exit(1) instead of return.
    Problem It Solved:
      - "return" in main() exits with code 0 (success). GitHub Actions saw the Python
        step succeed, continued to the ZIP step, and failed there with a confusing
        "empty directory" error - hiding the real cause.
      - Made debugging very slow: error appeared in the wrong step entirely.
    Conditions Now Covered:
      - Input root folder not found -> exits, prints the path it searched
      - No numbered subfolders found -> exits, prints directory contents
      - Specific folders file missing or unreadable -> exits with reason
      - None of the specified folder names matched -> exits, prints what it looked
        for vs what was actually available (most common cause: name mismatch)
    Result: Workflow fails at the Python step with the exact reason visible in logs.
    Code: main() - four sys.exit(1) calls replacing return statements

19. FLAT FOLDER SUPPORT
    Status: [OK] ACTIVE (Always, auto-detected)
    Added: v3.18.4
    What: Allows a main folder to contain JSON files directly with no numbered
          subfolders. The script detects this automatically and treats all files
          in the folder as a single pool (virtual subfolder 1.0).
    Structure Supported:
      NORMAL (numbered subfolders):        FLAT (files directly inside):
      20- Smth R2H/                        20- Smth R2H/
        1- action/                           file_a.json
          file.json                          file_b.json
        2- bank/                             always first.json
          file.json
    Behaviour:
      - Files are randomly selected from the pool each cycle (same as a regular
        numbered subfolder)
      - always_first / always_last tags in filenames still work
      - time_sensitive main folder tag still works
      - logout files are excluded from the pool automatically
      - Combination history tracks normally
    Detection: Triggered when zero numbered subfolders are found but JSON files
               exist directly in the folder
    Code: scan_for_numbered_subfolders() - flat folder block at end of function

21. DISTRACTION FILE GENERATION + INLINE INSERTION
    Status: [OK] ACTIVE (If DISTRACTIONS/ folder exists and is non-empty)
    Added: v3.18.14  Updated: v3.18.25
    What: Generates 50 distraction files simulating a player being momentarily
          distracted, then splices them randomly between folder transitions
          during stringing. Files are NOT saved to the bundle output folder -
          they are held in a temp folder and deleted after stringing completes.
    Activation:
      - Place a folder named "DISTRACTIONS" (case-insensitive) inside input_macros/
      - Place at least one .json file inside it (content irrelevant - just a trigger)
    Output:
      - 50 files generated in a temp folder, used for inline insertion, then deleted
      - Each file uses exactly 3 randomly chosen features from the 6 available
      - NEVER inserted into Raw or Inefficient versions - Normal only
    Per-file duration: random float 1-3 min (rng.uniform, never rounded)
    Insertion:
      - Per-folder chance: rng.uniform(7.0, 14.0)% (float decimal, once per folder)

    6 available distraction features (each file picks 3):
      - CURSOR WANDER   - 2-7 moves, per-call randomised speed envelope
      - CURSOR PAUSE    - 0.3-4s, per-call randomised drift probability + magnitude
      - RIGHT CLICK     - approach + click, per-call randomised offset + hover + hold
      - TYPING          - type word + erase, per-call randomised speed/hesitation
      - KEY SPAM        - spam key + erase, per-call randomised speed envelopes
      - SHAPE MOVEMENT  - circle/triangle/square/rectangle/star with random jitter
    All timing envelopes (lo/hi bounds) are re-drawn per call so each action
    invocation has a genuinely different character - not just different values
    within fixed ranges, but different ranges each time.

22. SHAPE MOVEMENT (distraction sub-feature)
    Status: [OK] ACTIVE (as one of 6 distraction features)
    Added: v3.18.24
    What: Traces geometric shapes with per-point jitter and randomised speed
    Shapes: circle/donut (3-5 laps), triangle (1-3 laps), square (1-3 laps),
            rectangle (1-3 laps), star (1-2 laps)
    Jitter: per-shape random magnitude rng.uniform(3.0, 10.0) px applied to
            every waypoint - shape remains recognisable but hand-drawn
    Speed: ms_per_seg = rng.uniform(80, 400) drawn once per shape, then
           +/-40% per segment for natural rhythm variation
    Code: _add_shape_movement()

20. FILE TRANSITION START GAP PROTECTION
    Status: [OK] ACTIVE (Always, when positions differ between files)
    Added: v3.18.10
    What: Inserts a short gap (80-150ms) between the cursor snap event and the
          first event of the incoming file at every file transition.
    Problem It Solved:
      - After a cursor transition path, the script places a final "snap" MouseMove
        at exactly 'timeline'. The first event of the next file also lands at
        exactly 'timeline' (its relative time is always 0ms after normalisation).
      - When that first event is a DragStart, both the snap and the DragStart share
        the same timestamp. The macro player interprets simultaneous events as
        concurrent - the drag fires with no physical separation from the move,
        causing the mouse to clamp at the start position.
    Fix: After placing the snap MouseMove, advance 'timeline' by 80-150ms before
         appending any file events. The sequence becomes:
           ...cursor path...
           +0ms   MouseMove (snap to start position)  ? transition end
           +80-150ms gap
           +0ms   DragStart (file begins)             ? safely separated
    Relationship to Feature 17:
      Feature 17 (Pre-play Buffer) protects the END of the outgoing file (prevents
      the previous DragEnd from being immediately followed by a cursor snap).
      Feature 20 protects the START of the incoming file (prevents the cursor snap
      from being immediately followed by the file's first DragStart).
      Both are needed; they guard opposite sides of every transition.
    Code: add_file_to_cycle() - post_snap_gap after final snap MouseMove

25. INTRA-FILE ZERO-GAP PROTECTION (Feature 25)
    Status: [OK] ACTIVE (Always, applied to every source file on load)
    Added: v3.18.30
    What: Scans each source file's raw events for MouseMove -> DragStart/LeftDown/
          RightDown/Click pairs where the gap is under 15ms (virtually simultaneous
          as recorded by the macro capture tool) and shifts the click event forward
          to create a clean 20ms separation.
    Problem It Solved:
      Some recordings capture the cursor arriving at a click position and the click
      itself within 1ms of each other (same coordinates). The macro player sees
      these as simultaneous - it cannot distinguish "cursor moved here, THEN clicked"
      from "both happened at once" - causing the left button to clamp and hold at
      that position, dragging everything underneath it.
      Example (from __20_F_53m7s.json, 34:03.908):
        MouseMove  X=885, Y=429  t=2043908ms
        DragStart  X=885, Y=429  t=2043909ms  ? 1ms gap = clamp!
    Fix: For every such pair with gap in [0, 15ms), all events from the click
         onward are shifted forward by (20 - gap) ms, creating a guaranteed
         20ms minimum between the arrival move and the click.
    Scope: Applied to the raw event list BEFORE any features (jitter, pauses,
           idle movements) are added, so it never interacts with or undoes the
           fix during later processing steps.
    Threshold: < 15ms gap = zero-gap (recording tool resolution)
    Target separation: 20ms (imperceptible to player, sufficient for macro player)
    Code: add_file_to_cycle() - scan loop after filter_problematic_keys()
    Status: [OK] ACTIVE (When distraction trigger present)
    Added: v3.18.29
    What: Distraction files are selected via a shuffled virtual queue - every one
          of the 50 generated files plays before any file is reused. When all 50
          have been inserted the queue re-shuffles and cycles again.
    Behaviour:
      - At generation time, the 50 files are loaded into a VirtualDistQueue
      - Each insertion pops the next file from the shuffled queue
      - When the queue empties it re-shuffles the full pool using the bundle RNG
      - Guarantees maximum variety: no distraction file repeats until all others
        have been used at least once
    Why it matters: With ~8-14% insertion chance per folder transition and many
      cycles, the same short file would previously appear repeatedly. Now each
      insertion draws from a rotating pool of all 50.
    Code: VirtualDistQueue class; dist_queue.next() in _maybe_insert_distraction()

24. 2:3:7 FILE RATIO DISTRIBUTION
    Status: [OK] ACTIVE (Always, scales with --versions)
    Added: v3.18.29
    What: Output files follow a 2:3:7 ratio (raw:inefficient:normal) regardless
          of how many total versions are requested.
    Formula:
      raw    = max(1, round(versions x 2/12))
      inef   = max(1, round(versions x 3/12))
      normal = versions ? raw ? inef   (remainder always goes to normal)
    Examples:
      --versions 12  -> 2 raw + 3 inef + 7 normal   (2:3:7 exact)
      --versions 24  -> 4 raw + 6 inef + 14 normal  (4:6:14 exact)
      --versions 20  -> 3 raw + 5 inef + 12 normal  (closest to 2:3:7)
      --versions 10  -> 2 raw + 2 inef + 6 normal
      --versions 6   -> 1 raw + 2 inef + 3 normal
    Time-sensitive override: if any folder is time-sensitive, inefficient count
      becomes 0 and all its slots are added to normal (raw count unchanged).
    Code: VERSION DISTRIBUTION block in the per-folder version loop
