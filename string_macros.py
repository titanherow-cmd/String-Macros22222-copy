STRING MACROS - FEATURE LIST
===========================================================================

  Current version: v3.19.26
  File ratio (default 12): 2 Raw - 3 Inef - 7 Normal  (2:3:7)
  Time-sensitive ratio:    6 Raw - 0 Inef - 6 Normal  (1:1)

===========================================================================
                    GROUP 1: PAUSE BREAKS
===========================================================================

1. WITHIN-FILE PAUSES
   Files: Normal + Inef (Raw = 0%)
   Value: random % drawn fresh per file (decimal, never rounded):
     Normal: rng.uniform(2%, 5%)  e.g. 2.14%, 3.87%
     Inef:   rng.uniform(10%, 15%)  e.g. 11.6%, 13.2%
   e.g. 20s Normal file at 3.4% -> 0.68s pause
   One pause per file in middle 80%. Skips drags, rapid-clicks, pre-DragStart.

2. PRE-PLAY BUFFER
   Files: ALL (including between cycles in the outer loop)
   Value: rng.uniform(500, 800) ms * mult — applied before every file and
   between every cycle boundary (end of cycle N -> start of cycle N+1).
   Between-cycle buffer was added in v3.18.45 to prevent 0ms gap between
   the last DragEnd of one cycle and the cursor transition of the next,
   which caused drag-click at wrong position.

2b. PER-VERSION TARGET DURATION VARIANCE
    Each version gets a random target duration of base +/- 5 minutes.
    e.g. --target-minutes 60 produces versions targeting 55-65 min each.
    Drawn as rng.uniform(-300000, +300000) ms float per version.
    The effective target (used by the build loop) uses this per-version value.
    Inef massive pause budget is also pre-sampled against the per-version target.
    Shown in print output: "Target: 62m 14s (base 60m +2.2m)"

3. INEF BEFORE-FILE PAUSE
   Files: Inef only, only if current cycle >= 25s
   Value: rng.uniform(10000, 30000) ms flat (no mult)
   Added between each full cycle (F1->...->FN loop).
   Cursor drifts during this pause toward next file start position.

4. INEFFICIENT MASSIVE PAUSE
   Files: Inef only
   Value: rng.uniform(240000, 420000) ms flat (no mult) = 4-7 min
   One pause inserted at a safe random point after all cycles complete.
   Loop pre-samples pause so total file stays near target duration.
   Safe: no drag, no rapid-click, not pre-DragStart, not first/last 10%.

5. MULTIPLIER SYSTEM
   Continuous random range, 4 decimal places (never rounded):
     Raw:    rng.uniform(1.1, 1.2)  e.g. 1.13, 1.17
     Normal: rng.uniform(1.5, 1.7)  e.g. 1.53, 1.67
     Inef:   rng.uniform(2.0, 3.0)  e.g. 2.14, 2.87
   Multiplied (baked in at generation time):
     - Pre-play buffer: rng.uniform(500, 800) * mult
     - Cursor transition: rng.uniform(200, 400) * mult
     - Within-file % pause: file_duration * pct (pct not multiplied; the pause
       duration grows with larger files naturally)
     - Mid-event random pause (50% chance/cycle): rng.uniform(200, 800) * mult
   NOT multiplied (flat): inef before-file pause, massive pause, distraction files

===========================================================================
                    GROUP 2: PATTERN BREAKING
===========================================================================

6. CURSOR TRANSITION TO START POINT
   Files: ALL (SKIPPED for click-sensitive)
   Value: rng.uniform(200, 400) ms * mult — human path between files.
   Skipped entirely for click-sensitive folders.

7. IDLE CURSOR WANDERING
   Files: ALL (SKIPPED for click-sensitive)
   Fills existing recording gaps > 2000ms with cursor arcs/drifts.
   Does NOT add time — movements fit inside the existing gap.
   Not shown in manifest (zero time impact on total).

8. MOUSE JITTER
   Files: ALL (SKIPPED for click-sensitive)
   Value: 9-21% of mouse moves get +/-1-3px random offsets.
   Excluded near drags, rapid-click sequences, first/last 10% of file.

9. VIRTUAL QUEUE - SUBFOLDER FILES
   Each subfolder has its own shuffled queue. No file repeats until all
   others used. Boundary guard prevents same file at queue wrap.
   Same mechanism applies to distraction files (Feature 32).

===========================================================================
                    GROUP 3: SMOOTH OPERATION
===========================================================================

10. RAPID CLICK PROTECTION
    3+ clicks within 1500ms detected. Jitter exclusion extended to 1500ms.
    Detection set includes: Click, DragStart, LeftDown, LeftUp, RightDown, RightUp.
    LeftDown/LeftUp added (v3.18.81) so native button-event double-clicks are
    also protected — previously only 'Click' and 'DragStart' were detected.

11. DRAG OPERATION PROTECTION
    Hold+Move+Release detected. No jitter during entire drag sequence.

12. EVENT TIMING INTEGRITY
    No modifications inside drags, pre-DragStart, rapid-clicks, or first/
    last 10%. Prevents click-hold clamping (unintended long drags).

13. COMBINATION HISTORY
    Tracks used file combos per subfolder across cycles.
    Avoids repeating same combination. Persists via uploaded .txt files.

14. MANUAL HISTORY UPLOAD
    Upload COMBINATION_HISTORY_XX.txt to input_macros/combination_history/
    All .txt files read; those combos avoided in future runs.

15. ALPHABETICAL FILE NAMING
    Raw: ^XX_A  Inef: XX_C (not-sign prefix)  Normal: XX_E (no prefix)
    Output folder: (bundle_id) folder_name

16. FOLDER-NUMBER STRUCTURE
    F1, F2, F3.5 etc. F<N> prefix preferred; other numbers in name ignored.
    e.g. "F3- press 1 to bank" -> num=3, the "1" in name is ignored.

17. OPTIONAL TAG
    Default chance: rng.uniform(24%, 33%) per bundle (decimal, never rounded).
    Custom number: used as CENTRE of +/-2% random range (never rounded).
      e.g. "optional23" -> rng.uniform(21%, 25%)
           "optional50" -> rng.uniform(48%, 52%)
           "optional50.5" -> rng.uniform(48.5%, 52.5%)
    This adds variety so the same folder never hits the exact same threshold.
    Range clamped so it never goes below 1% or above 99%.
    Max-files/loops: "optional58-6-" = 58% centre, pick 1-6 files/loops.
    No optional: "F1-4-" = always included, pick 1-4 files.
    always_first/last wraps the entire picked group once (not per file).
    For nested folders: -N- means max N complete sub-cycles (loops), not files.

18. END TAG
    Uses word-boundary match ( end ) — "tend" does NOT match.
    Loop stops after this folder. Always included if reached.

19. OPTIONAL+END COMBO TAG
    Chosen = loop stops here. Skipped = loop continues.
    Renamed from "optional/end" in v3.18.42.

20. TIME SENSITIVE TAG
    Ratio: 1:1 (half raw, half normal, zero inef).
    Main folder tag propagates to ALL subfolders.

21. CLICK SENSITIVE TAG
    Disables ALL coordinate-changing features:
    cursor path, mouse jitter, idle wandering, distraction insertion.
    Main folder tag propagates to ALL subfolders.
    Accepted: "click sensitive" / "click/time sensitive" / "click+time sensitive"

22. CLICK/TIME SENSITIVE COMBO TAG
    Both tag rules active: 1:1 ratio + no cursor/jitter/idle/distraction.

23. DONT USE FEATURES ON ME TAG
    Exact folder name (case-insensitive). Files inserted completely unmodified.
    Marked [UNMODIFIED] in manifest.

24. ALWAYS FIRST / LAST FILES
    Tag in FILENAME (not folder name). Three modes:
    A) Root-level (next to F1/F2/F3 subfolders): fires ONCE per strung file,
       before all cycles start and after all cycles end.
    B) Inside a specific subfolder (e.g. F0): wraps ONLY that subfolder's files.
       Pattern: [AF] -> F0 files -> [AL] -> F1 -> F2 -> ...
    C) Flat/single-subfolder folder: fires ONCE at very start and very end.
    For nested folders (Feature 39): AF/AL wrap all loops together, not per loop.

25. COMPREHENSIVE MANIFEST
    !_MANIFEST_XX_!.txt in output folder. Shows per-version:
    - File type, multiplier, total pause added
    - Breakdown (x = mult applied, - = flat): PRE-Play Buffer, Within File Pauses,
      CURSOR to Start Point, POST-SNAP GAP, DISTRACTION File Pause,
      INEFFICIENT Before File Pause, INEFFICIENT MASSIVE PAUSE
    - Full file list with cumulative end times

26. SPECIFIC FOLDERS FILTERING
    --specific-folders <file>: process only folders (and optionally subfolders)
    listed in the file. Matching is case-insensitive, whitespace-stripped.

    File format (one entry per line):
      FolderName                   -> include folder, ALL its subfolders
      FolderName: F1, F3, F4       -> include folder, ONLY subfolders F1 F3 F4
      FolderName: F1, F3-F5        -> include folder, F1 and range F3 through F5

    Examples:
      22- Craft Dia- edge- lamp bank Z- S
      22- Craft Dia- edge- lamp bank Z- S: F1, F2, F4
      58- Smth R2H only: F1-F3

    - Subfolder numbers are case-insensitive (F1 = f1 = 1)
    - Decimal subfolders supported: F3.5
    - If a requested subfolder doesn't exist, it is skipped with a warning
    - Output folder: (bundle_id) folder_name

27. CHAT INSERTS
    --no-chat disables. After all versions are saved, floor(total * 0.20)
    files are chosen at random (all types eligible, including raw) and one
    chat file is spliced into each. 10 files → 2; 22 → 4; 5 → 1; 4 → 0.

28. PRE-PLAY BUFFER GUARANTEE
    files_added int counter (not list truthiness) ensures buffer fires before
    every file including always_first/last. Avoids Python nonlocal edge case.

29. FAIL-FAST ERROR HANDLING
    Fatal errors call sys.exit(1) so GitHub Actions fails at the right step.

30. FLAT FOLDER SUPPORT
    JSON files directly in main folder (no numbered subfolders) = single pool.
    All tags (always_first/last, time_sensitive, click_sensitive) still work.

31. DISTRACTION FILE GENERATION + INSERTION
    Trigger: DISTRACTIONS/ folder in input_macros/
    Generates 50 temp files (30s-2min), each using 3 of 7 features:
    wander, pause, right-click, typing, key-spam, shapes, backspace-hold.
    backspace-hold (v3.18.83): holds Backspace 1-3 s (float ms, not rounded).
    Chance: Normal 3.5-5%, Inef 3.5-7%, Raw 0%, Click-sensitive 0%.
    NOT multiplied — flat pre-built durations. Shown in manifest.

32. VIRTUAL QUEUE - DISTRACTION FILES
    All 50 distraction files rotate before any repeat.
    Boundary guard prevents consecutive repeat at queue wrap.

33. 2:3:7 FILE RATIO DISTRIBUTION
    raw=round(v x 2/12), inef=round(v x 3/12), normal=remainder.
    12->2:3:7, 24->4:6:14, 20->3:5:12.
    Time-sensitive override: 1:1 raw:normal, zero inef.

34. FILE TRANSITION START GAP PROTECTION
    80-150ms gap (POST-SNAP GAP) between snap MouseMove and first event of
    next file. Prevents zero-gap DragStart = cursor clamp at transition.
    Tracked in manifest as flat (no mult).

35. INTRA-FILE ZERO-GAP PROTECTION
    On load: two checks, both shift all events from the click forward.
    Part A — MouseMove->ButtonDown gap < 30ms shifted to 35ms.
    Prevents fast-cursor recordings clicking short of target tile.
    Raised from 15→30ms (v3.19.06): 15-29ms gaps were slipping through.
    Part B — DragEnd->DragStart gap < 200ms shifted to 200ms.
    Prevents rapid DragStart re-press. Threshold raised 150→200ms v3.18.92.
    Part C (v3.19.02) — any button-event->button-down gap < 200ms shifted
    to 200ms. Catches LeftUp→LeftDown, DragEnd→LeftDown, LD→LD (missing
    release), and all cross-type rapid re-press cases missed by A and B.
    Applied before any other features, to raw events only.

36. ORIGINAL FILES DEDUPLICATION
    Counts each unique filename once across all subfolders.
    Copied subfolders shown as "(N copied folder(s))" in manifest.

37. MAX-FILES TAG
    "-N-" in folder name = pick 1-N files (or loops for nested folders).
    "F3 optional58-6-" = 58% chance, 1-6 files.
    "F1-4-" = always included, 1-4 files.

38. PROBLEMATIC KEY FILTERING
    On load (before any features): strips keys that break macro playback.
    Filtered: HOME(36), END(35), PAGE_UP(33), PAGE_DOWN(34), PAUSE(19),
              PRINT_SCREEN(44)
    Kept: ESC(27) — valid in-game action (closing menus, cancelling dialogs).
    IMPORTANT: base_time captured BEFORE filtering so files whose only early
    event is a filtered key (e.g. END at t=90ms) keep their full duration.
    Without this, the 90ms anchor is lost and the file collapses to near-zero.

39. NESTED SUBFOLDER SUPPORT
    A numbered subfolder (e.g. F5) can contain its own F1/F2/F3/F4 instead
    of direct JSON files. Detected automatically during scanning.
    -N- on the outer folder = max N complete inner loops (not N files).
    always_first/last at F5's root level fire ONCE before all loops and
    ONCE after all loops (not per loop).
    Internal subfolders support all tags: optional, end, time/click sensitive.
    Separate ManualHistoryTracker maintained for nested folder's combos.

40. LOGOUT SEQUENCE FOLDER (Feature 40)
    Trigger: folder named '@logout_base' (case-insensitive) at the root
    level of input_macros/.
    Contents: .json files assigned by numeric prefix in filename.
      Files assigned by numeric prefix in filename (e.g. '1- logout.json' → slot 1).
      Sub-slots supported (e.g. '1.1-' sorts between 1 and 2).
      Random wait fires after the last file whose prefix is 2.x.
      Any number of slots supported; minimum: one pre-2, one 2.x, one post-2.
    Two break files built per output folder (each with a fresh random wait):
    Long break:  7200000–16200000 ms (2h–4.5h)
    Short break: 1800000– 5400000 ms (30min–90min)
    Float ms, never rounded.
    Outputs: "@ LOGOUT LONG BREAK.json" + "@ LOGOUT SHORT BREAK.json"
    Features: NO anti-detection features applied (files inserted raw).
              filter_problematic_keys() is applied on load.
    Output: written to output_root/- logout.json, then copied to each
            bundle folder as "@ N LOGOUT.JSON" (same as static logout file).
    Priority: takes precedence over the legacy '- logout.json' static file.
    Fallback: if the folder is missing, the old static file search still runs.
    The folder is excluded from the main macro scan (not treated as a macro folder).
    Dedicated rng seeded from bundle_id + 31337 — does not affect main rng state.

41. SAME-NUMBER FOLDER POOLING (Feature 41)
    Multiple physical subfolders that share the same F-number are merged into
    a single logical slot in the cycle. The cycle still sees one slot per
    unique number; the combined pool of all matching folders is used for
    file selection and always_first/last picking.
    Examples:
      F2- Click anvil, F2- Click anvil - Copy, F2- dance
        → one F2 slot; files from all three folders pooled together
      F0 optional28-13-, F0 optional28-13- (1)
        → one F0 slot; 28% chance, pick up to 13 files from combined pool
    Merge rules:
      - files / always_first / always_last: concatenated
      - Boolean tags (is_optional, is_end, is_time_sensitive, is_click_sensitive):
        OR — if ANY contributing folder has the tag, the merged slot gets it
      - Scalar tags (optional_chance, max_files): first non-None value wins
      - Nested subfolders: inner dicts merged by inner slot number
    A [Pool] log line is printed for each merge: "F2: merged 'name' (N files total)"
    Trigger: folder named '@logout_base' (case-insensitive) at the root
    level of input_macros/.
    Contents: .json files assigned by numeric prefix in filename.
      Files assigned by numeric prefix in filename (e.g. '1- logout.json' → slot 1).
      Sub-slots supported (e.g. '1.1-' sorts between 1 and 2).
      Random wait fires after the last file whose prefix is 2.x.
      Any number of slots supported; minimum: one pre-2, one 2.x, one post-2.
    Two break files built per output folder (each with a fresh random wait):
    Long break:  7200000–16200000 ms (2h–4.5h)
    Short break: 1800000– 5400000 ms (30min–90min)
    Float ms, never rounded.
    Outputs: "@ LOGOUT LONG BREAK.json" + "@ LOGOUT SHORT BREAK.json"
    Features: NO anti-detection features applied (files inserted raw).
              filter_problematic_keys() is applied on load.
    Output: written to output_root/- logout.json, then copied to each
            bundle folder as "@ N LOGOUT.JSON" (same as static logout file).
    Priority: takes precedence over the legacy '- logout.json' static file.
    Fallback: if the folder is missing, the old static file search still runs.
    The folder is excluded from the main macro scan (not treated as a macro folder).
    Dedicated rng seeded from bundle_id + 31337 — does not affect main rng state.

42. GROUP FOLDER SUPPORT
    Organizer folders one level below input_macros/ whose children have
    F-numbered subfolders (but the organizer itself does not) are treated as
    group folders. Selecting a group name runs all its children individually.
    Structure: input_macros/GroupName/Macro1, Macro2, ...
    Special folders (DISTRACTIONS, LOGOUT, combination_history, @logout_base, @logout_extras) are never groups.

43. HARDCODED SKILL-SPECIFIC LOGOUT EXTRAS (Feature 43 - v3.19.26)
    Supports stitching folder-specific extra JSON segments onto the end of logout
    macros by looking inside `@logout_extras/<SkillFolderName>/`. Numbered files
    inside the extras folder are sorted, validated, and merged seamlessly. If no
    matching subfolder exists inside `@logout_extras`, the script falls back to
    generating the standard 4-file logout macro.

===========================================================================

CHANGELOG (recent):
===========================================================================
- v3.19.26: Redesigned the logout compilation system to use a clean folder-based layout.
            Standard logout files live inside '@logout_base' (such as 0- close, 1- logout, etc).
            Special skill-specific segments are stored inside '@logout_extras/<SkillFolderName>/'.
            If a matching subfolder name exists inside '@logout_extras', its numbered files
            are dynamically loaded, sorted numerically, and stitched onto the end of the logout
            macro. Name reflects the complete active sequence (e.g. @ 012356 Proper logout...).
            Both system folders are explicitly bypassed in general macro scanning.
- v3.19.25: Reverted skill-specific logout approach (v3.19.20-24).
            New design: if a skill folder (e.g. '6- Smithing files/')
            contains its own 'LOGOUT, wait, in' subfolder, that folder
            is used to build all logout files for that skill's subfolders.
            Falls back to global input_macros/LOGOUT, wait, in/ otherwise.
            No filename parsing or skill-tag matching needed -- the folder
            structure itself carries the skill-specific information.
            @ 0123 Proper logout+wait+RELOGIN.json (and variants) built
            dynamically per output folder; name reflects actual slots used.
            Long/short break random wait behaviour unchanged.
            Removed: _extract_skill_tag_from_logout_name,
                     _logout_tag_matches_folder, _skill_folder_name.
